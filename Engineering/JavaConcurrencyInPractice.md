    - Threads allow multiple streams of program control flow to coexist within a process.
      They share process-wide resources such as memory and file handles, but
      each thread has its own program counter, stack, and local variables.
    - Threads are sometimes called lightweight processes, and most modern operating
      systems treat threads, not processes, as the basic units of scheduling.
    - **Risks of threads**  
        - Safety hazards    
        - Liveness hazards  
        - Performance hazards
