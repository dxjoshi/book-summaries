- **Introduction: The First 90 Days**
    - Opinions of your effectiveness begin to form surprisingly quickly, and, once formed, they’re very hard to change. 
      **If you’re successful in building credibility and securing early wins, the momentum likely will propel you through the rest of your tenure.** 
      But if you dig yourself into a hole early on, you will face an uphill battle from that point forward.
    - **Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point.** This is the point at which you have contributed as much value to your new organization as you have consumed from it.  
    - **Avoiding Transition Traps** 
        - Sticking with what you know.
        - Falling prey to the “action imperative.”
        - Setting unrealistic expectations
        - Attempting to do too much.
        - Coming in with “the” answer.
        - Engaging in the wrong type of learning
        - Neglecting horizontal relationships.
    - **Creating Momentum:** But your **objective is not only to avoid vicious cycles; you need to create virtuous cycles that help you create momentum and establish an upward spiral of increasing effectiveness.** 
      **Good initial decisions founded on the right kind of learning, for example, bolster your personal credibility.** As people come to trust your judgment, your ability to learn accelerates, and you equip yourself to make sound calls on tougher issues.     
    - **Understanding the Fundamental Principles:** 
        - Transition failures happen because new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.    
    - Do the right things, the essential transition tasks listed next and you will rapidly create momentum that will propel you to even greater successes:      
        - **Prepare yourself**      
        - **Accelerate your learning**  
        - **Match your strategy to the situation**
        - **Secure early wins**
        - **Negotiate success** 
        - **Achieve alignment** 
        - **Build your team**
        - **Create coalitions**
        - **Keep your balance**
        - **Accelerate everyone**
    - **Mapping Out Your First 90 Days**    
        - **Start planning what you hope to accomplish by specific milestones:** Fist Day, First Week, First month, 2nd month, 3rd month.
    - **Top Questions:**    
        1. What will it take for you to reach the break-even point more quickly?
        2. What are some traps you might encounter, and how can you avoid them?
        3. What can you do to create virtuous cycles and build momentum in your new role?
        4. What types of transitions are you experiencing? Which are you finding most challenging, and why?
        5. What are the key elements and milestones in your 90-day plan?         
    
- **CHAPTER 1: Prepare Yourself**   
    - It’s a mistake to believe that you will be successful in your new job by continuing to do what you did in your previous job, only more so.                     
    - The starting point for preparing yourself is to understand the types of transitions you’re experiencing.
        - **1: Getting Promoted**   
            - Balance Breadth and Depth
            - Rethink What You Delegate
            - Influence Differently : It’s critical, then, for you to become more effective at building and sustaining alliances.   
            - Communicate More Formally
            - Exhibit the Right Presence : 
        - **2: Onboarding into a New Company**  
            - Leaders joining new companies often are making lateral moves: they’ve been hired to do things that they’ve been successful doing elsewhere. **Their difficulties lie in adjusting to new organizational contexts that have different political structures and cultures.**    
            - To overcome these barriers and succeed in joining a new company, you should focus on four pillars of effective onboarding:
                - Business Orientation
                - Stakeholder Connection
                - Expectations Alignment
                - Cultural Adaptation
                    - At the top of the culture pyramid are the surface elements—the symbols, shared languages, and other things most visible to outsiders. Obvious symbols include organizational logos, the way people dress, and the way office space is organized and allocated.
                    - So it’s essential that you invest early on in learning to speak like the locals.
                    - Hidden Patterns: These elements of culture include things like how people get support for important initiatives, how they win recognition for their accomplishments, and how they view meetings— are they seen as forums for discussion or rubber-stamp sessions?
                     
        - **Identifying Cultural Norms:**
            - The following domains are areas in which cultural norms may vary significantly from company to company. Transitioning leaders should use this checklist to help them figure out how things really work in the organizations they’re joining.
                - **Influence**. How do people get support for critical initiatives? Is it more important to have the support of a patron within the senior team, or affirmation from your peers and direct reports that your idea is a good one?
                - **Meetings**. Are meetings filled with dialogue on hard issues, or are they simply forums for publicly ratifying agreements that have been reached in private?
                - **Execution**. When it comes time to get things done, which matters more—a deep understanding of processes or knowing the right people?
                - **Conflict**. Can people talk openly about difficult issues without fear of retribution? Or do they avoid conflict—or, even worse, push it to lower levels, where it can wreak havoc?
                - **Recognition**. Does the company promote stars, rewarding those who visibly and vocally drive business initiatives? Or does it encourage team players, rewarding those who lead authoritatively but quietly and collaboratively?
                - **Ends versus means**. Are there any restrictions on how you achieve results? Does the organization have a well-defined, well-communicated set of values that is reinforced through positive and negative incentives? 
        - **Preparing Yourself:**  
            - **Establish a Clear Breakpoint:** Consciously think of letting go of the old job and embracing the new one. Think hard about the differences between the two, and consider how you must now think and act differently. Take the time to celebrate your move, even informally, with family and friends. Use the time to touch base with your informal advisers and counselors and to ask for advice. The bottom line: do whatever it takes to get into the transition state of mind. 
            - You can do a lot to compensate for your vulnerabilities. Three basic tools are self-discipline, team building, and advice and counsel. 
              You need to discipline yourself to devote time to critical activities that you do not enjoy and that may not come naturally. 
              **Beyond that, actively search out people in your organization whose skills are sharp in these areas, so that they can serve as a backstop for you and you can learn from them.** 
              A network of advisers and counselors can also help you move beyond your comfort zone.                                            
            - **Watch Out for Your Strengths:** The qualities that have made you successful so far (it’s worth being clear in your own mind what your hammer is) can prove to be weaknesses in your new role. 
            - **Relearn How to Learn:** Relearning how to learn can be stressful. So if you find yourself waking up in a cold sweat, take comfort. Most new leaders experience the same feelings. And if you embrace the need to learn, you can surmount them.
            - **Rework Your Network:** 
            - **Watch Out for People Who Want to Hold You Back:** If you have been promoted to supervise people who were once your peers, some may be disappointed competitors. Some may even work to undermine you. This kind of thing may subside with time. **But expect early tests of your authority, and plan to meet them by being firm and fair. If you don’t establish limits early, you will live to regret it.** Getting others to accept your move is an essential part of preparing yourself.  

- **CHAPTER 2: Accelerate Your Learning**   
    - **The first task in making a successful transition is to accelerate your learning**. Effective learning gives you the foundational insights you need as you build your plan for the next 90 days. So it is essential to figure out what you need to know about your new organization and then to learn it as rapidly as you can. The more efficiently and effectively you learn, the more quickly you will close your window of vulnerability. You can identify potential problems that might erupt and take you offtrack. The faster you climb the learning curve, the earlier you can begin to make good business decisions.    
    - **Overcoming Learning Roadblocks:**   
        - **Early in your transition you inevitably feel as if you are drinking from a fire hose**. There is so much to absorb that it’s difficult to know where to focus. Amid the torrent of information coming your way, it’s easy to miss important signals.
          Or **you might focus too much on the technical side of the business—products, customers, technologies, and strategies—and shortchange critical learning about culture and politics**.
        - A related problem is a failure to plan to learn. Planning to learn means figuring out in advance what the important questions are and how you can best answer them. **Few new leaders take the time to think systematically about their learning priorities. Fewer still explicitly create a learning plan when entering a new role**.
        - **Some leaders even have “learning roadblocks,” internal barriers to learning. One example is Chris’s failure to focus on understanding the history of the organization. A baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?” Otherwise, you risk tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they were put there in the first place.** Armed with insight into the organization’s history, you may indeed decide that things need to change. Or you may find there is a good reason to leave it exactly where it is.    
        - A related learning block, as mentioned in the introduction, is the action imperative. **The primary symptom is a nearly compulsive need to take action. Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting)**. But it is challenging, as Chris Hadley found, to let yourself “be” during transitions. **And the pressure to “do” almost always comes more from inside the leader than from outside forces; it reflects a lack of confidence and a consequent need to prove yourself**. 
          **Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence.**              
    - **Managing Learning as an Investment Process:**  
        - **If you approach your efforts to get up to speed as an investment process—and your scarce time and energy as resources that deserve careful management—you will realize returns in the form of actionable insights. An actionable insight is knowledge that enables you to make better decisions earlier and so helps you quickly reach the break-even point in personal value creation.**   
        - To maximize your return on investment in learning, you must effectively and efficiently extract actionable insights from the mass of information available to you. **Effective learning calls for figuring out what you need to learn so that you can focus your efforts. Devote some time to defining your learning agenda as early as possible, and return to it periodically to refine and supplement it.**
          **Efficient learning means identifying the best available sources of insight and then figuring out how to extract maximum insight with the least possible outlay of time.**
    - **Defining Your Learning Agenda:**
        - The starting point is to begin to define your learning agenda, ideally before you formally enter the organization. **A learning agenda crystallizes your learning priorities: what do you most need to learn? It consists of a focused set of questions to guide your inquiry or the hypotheses you want to explore and test, or both.**
          Of course, learning during a transition is iterative: at first, your learning agenda will consist mostly of questions, but as you learn more, you will hypothesize about what is going on and why. Increasingly, your learning will shift toward fleshing out and testing those hypotheses.   
    - **Identifying the Best Sources of Insight:**  
        - If you are new to the organization, there often is much you can do to accelerate the onboarding process before you arrive. The starting point, beyond the recruiting process, **is to leverage the rich array of resources available online, including background information and analysis of the organization, biographies of key people, and information available on the organization’s own website**. Beyond that, it is highly desirable, if possible, to reach out to current or former employees to get a bead on the history and culture.
    - **Adopting Structured Learning Methods:** 
        - When you are diagnosing a new organization, start by meeting with your direct reports one-on-one.   
        - Suppose you decide to meet with your direct reports one-on-one. In what order will you meet with them? And how will you avoid being excessively influenced by what the first couple of people say? One approach is to keep to the same script in all your meetings. You might start with brief opening remarks about yourself and your approach, followed by questions about the other person (background, family, and interests) and then a standard set of questions about the business. This approach is powerful, because the responses you get are comparable. You can line them up side by side and analyze what is consistent and inconsistent about the responses. This comparison helps you gain insight into which people are being more or less open.
        - Another example of a **structured learning method is the use of a framework such as SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis to guide your diagnostic work. These sorts of frameworks also can be powerful tools for communicating with key stakeholders—bosses, peers, and direct reports—to help create shared views of the situation.**         
    - **Creating a Learning Plan:** 
        - Your learning agenda defines what you want to learn. Your learning plan defines how you will go about learning it. **It translates learning goals into specific sets of actions—identifying promising sources of insight and using systematic methods—that accelerate your learning.** Your learning plan is a critical part of your overall 90-day plan. In fact, as you will discover later, **learning should be a primary focus of your plan for your first 30 days on the job** (unless, of course, there is a disaster in progress).

- **CHAPTER 3: Match Strategy to Situation**
    - Armed with insight into your STARS portfolio and the key challenges and opportunities, you will adopt the right strategies for leading change. Doing so means, however, adopting the approaches laid out in this book for creating momentum in your next 90 days. Specifically, you must establish priorities, define strategic intent, identify where you can secure early wins, build the right leadership team, and create supporting alliances.                
    - **Managing Yourself:**    

- **CHAPTER 4: Negotiate Success**
    - To succeed as Michael did with a new boss, it’s wise to negotiate success. **It’s well worth investing time in this critical relationship up front, because your new boss sets your benchmarks, interprets your actions for other key players, and controls access to resources you need. He will have more impact than any other individual on how quickly you reach the break-even point, and on your eventual success or failure.**    
    - **This chapter shows you how to engage in the right kinds of dialogue with your new boss.** Read it even if you will be reporting to the same boss in your new role. Your relationship likely won’t stay the same. The boss’s expectations may be different, and you may need more resources. Many managers mistakenly assume that they can continue to work with a current boss in the same way despite being in a different role. Don’t make this error.    
    - **How do you build a productive relationship with a new boss? There are some basic do’s and don’ts. Let’s start with the don’ts.**
        - **Don’t stay away:** It may feel good to be given a lot of rope, but resist the urge to take it. **Get on your boss’s calendar regularly. Be sure your boss is aware of the issues you face and that you are aware of her expectations, especially whether and how they’re shifting.**
        - **Don’t surprise your boss:** It’s usually best to give your new boss at least a heads-up as soon as you become aware of a developing problem.    
        - **Don’t approach your boss only with problems:** That said, you don’t want to be perceived as bringing nothing but problems for your boss to solve. You also need to have plans for how you will proceed. 
        This emphatically does not mean that you must fashion full-blown solutions: the outlay of time and effort to generate solutions can easily lure you down the rocky road to surprising your boss. 
        **The key here is to give some thought to how to address the problem—even if it is only gathering more information—and to your role and the help you will need.**
        - **Don’t run down your checklist:** There is a tendency, even for senior leaders, to use meetings with a boss as an opportunity to run through your checklist of what you’ve been doing. Sometimes this is appropriate, but it is rarely what your boss needs or wants to hear. **You should assume she wants to focus on the most important things you’re trying to do and how she can help. Don’t go in without at most three things you really need to share or on which you need action.**
        - **Don’t expect your boss to change:** You and your new boss may have very different working styles. You may communicate in different ways, motivate in different ways, and prefer different levels of detail in overseeing your direct reports. **But it’s your responsibility to adapt to your boss’s style; you need to adapt your approach to work with your boss’s preferences.**
    - **Some fundamental do’s:**
        - **Clarify expectations early and often:** Begin managing expectations from the moment you consider taking a new role. Focus on expectations during the interview process.
        Revisiting expectations is especially important if you’re onboarding from the outside and don’t have a deep understanding of the culture and politics.        
        - **Take 100 percent responsibility for making the relationship work:** Don’t expect your boss to reach out or to offer you the time and support you need. 
        **It’s best to begin by assuming that it’s on your shoulders to make the relationship work.** If your boss meets you partway, it will be a welcome surprise.     
        - **Negotiate time lines for diagnosis and action planning:** Don’t let yourself get caught up immediately in firefighting or be pressured to make calls before you’re ready. **Buy yourself some time, even if it’s only a few weeks, to diagnose the new organization and come up with an action plan.**
        - **Aim for early wins in areas important to the boss:** Whatever your own priorities, figure out what your boss cares about most. What are his priorities and goals, and how do your actions fit into this picture? Once you know, aim for early results in those areas. **One good way is to focus on three things that are important to your boss and discuss what you’re doing about them every time you interact. In that way, your boss will feel ownership of your success.** 
        - **Pursue good marks from those whose opinions your boss respects:** Your new boss’s opinion of you will be based in part on direct interactions and in part on what she hears about you from trusted others. Your boss will have preexisting relationships with people who are now your peers and possibly your subordinates. You needn’t curry favor with the people your boss trusts. **Simply be alert to the multiple channels through which information and opinion about you will reach your boss.**    
    - **Planning for Five Conversations:** In fact, it’s valuable to include plans for five specific conversations with your new boss about transition-related subjects in your 90- day plan. These are not subjects to be dealt with in separate meetings but are intertwined threads of dialogue.  
        - **The situational diagnosis conversation**. In this conversation, you seek to understand how your new boss sees the STARS portfolio you have inherited. Are there elements of start-up, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment, and sustaining success?  
        - **The expectations conversation**. Your goal in this conversation is to understand and negotiate expectations. What does your new boss need you to do in the short term and in the medium term? What will constitute success? Critically, how will your performance be measured? Also, as part of your broader campaign to secure early wins, discussed in the next chapter, **keep in mind that it’s better to underpromise and overdeliver.**
        - **The resource conversation**. This conversation is essentially a negotiation for critical resources. What do you need to be successful? What do you need your boss to do? The resources need not be limited to funding or personnel. 
        **Key here is to focus your boss on the benefits and costs of what you can accomplish with different amounts of resources.**
        - **The style conversation**.This conversation is about how you and your new boss can best interact on an ongoing basis. What forms of communication does he prefer, and for what? Face-to-face? Voice, electronic? How often?
        What kinds of decisions does he want to be consulted on, and when can you make the call on your own? 
        How do your styles differ, and what are the implications for the ways you should interact? 
        - **The personal development conversation**. Once you’re a few months into your new role, you can begin to discuss how you’re doing and what your developmental priorities should be. 
        **Where are you doing well?** 
        **In what areas do you need to improve or do things differently?** 
        **Are there projects or special assignments you could undertake (without sacrificing focus)?**     
        **What responsibilities I need to undertake to reach the next level?**
        - **Take time to plan for each conversation, and signal clearly to your boss what you hope to accomplish in each exchange.**     
    - **Planning the Expectations Conversation:** The point of the expectations conversation is for you and your boss to clarify and align your expectations about the future. **You need to agree on short- and medium-term goals and on timing.** Critically, you need to agree on how your boss will measure progress. What will constitute success, for your boss and for you? When does your boss expect to see results? How will you measure success? Over what time frame? If you succeed, what is next? **If you don’t manage expectations, they will manage you.** 
    - **Planning the Five Conversations with Your Team:** You won’t merely have a new boss; you are likely to be a new boss as well. You will almost certainly have new subordinates. Just as you need to develop a productive relationship with your new boss, so, too, will they need to work effectively with you.
    **The golden rule of transitions is to transition others as you would wish to be transitioned yourself (see “The Golden Rule of Transitions”).**
    - Do you transition others as you would wish to be transitioned yourself? If there is a big inconsistency between how you prefer to be dealt with as a new direct report and how you deal with new direct reports, then you are part of the problem.  

- **CHAPTER 5: Secure Early Wins**
    - By the end of the first few months, you want your boss, your peers, and your subordinates to feel that something new, something good, is happening. **Early wins excite and energize people and build your personal credibility. Done well, they help you create value for your new organization earlier and reach the break-even point much more quickly.**
    - **Starting with the Goal:** As you strive to create momentum, therefore, **keep in mind that your early wins must do double duty: they must help you build momentum in the short term and lay a foundation for achieving your longer-term business goals.** So be sure that your plans for securing early wins, to the greatest extent possible, (1) are consistent with your agreed-to goals—what your bosses and key stakeholders expect you to achieve—and (2) help you introduce the new patterns of behavior you need to achieve those goals.    
    - **Adopting Basic Principles:**  
        - **Focus on a few promising opportunities**. It’s easy to take on too much during a transition, and the results can be ruinous. You cannot hope to achieve results in more than a couple of areas during your transition. **Thus, it’s essential to identify the most promising opportunities and then focus relentlessly on translating them into wins. Think of it as risk management: pursue enough focal points to have a good shot at getting a significant success, but not so many that your efforts get diffused.**    
        - Get wins that matter to your boss
        - Get wins in the right ways
        - **Adjust for the culture:** In some organizations, a win must be a visible individual accomplishment. In others, individual pursuit of glory, even if it achieves good results, is viewed as grandstanding and destructive of teamwork. In team-oriented organizations, early wins could come in the form of leading a team in the development of a new product idea or being viewed as a solid contributor and team player in a broader initiative. **Be sure you understand what is and is not viewed as a win, especially if you’re onboarding into the organization.**
    - **Identifying Your Early Wins:**  
        - You should think about what you need to do in two phases: **building personal credibility in roughly the first 30 days, and deciding which projects you will launch to achieve early performance improvements beyond that.**
        - **Understand Your Reputation:** When you arrive, people will rapidly begin to assess you and your capabilities. In part, this evaluation will be based on what people think they already “know” about you. You can be sure people have talked to people who have talked to people who have worked with you in the past. **So like it or not, you will start your role with a reputation, deserved or not. The risk, of course, is that your reputation will become reality, because people tend to focus on information that confirms their beliefs and screen out information that doesn’t—the so-called confirmation bias.**
        **The implication is that you need to figure out what role people are expecting you to play and then make an explicit decision about whether you will reinforce these expectations or confound them.**
        - **Build Credibility:** In your first few weeks in your new job, you cannot hope to have a measurable impact on performance, but you can score small victories and signal that things are changing. Think of this as an effort to secure early, early wins by building your personal credibility.
        So how do you build personal credibility? **In part, it’s about marketing yourself effectively, much akin to building equity in a brand. You want people to associate you with attractive capabilities, attitudes, and values. There’s no single right answer for how to do this. In general, though, new leaders are perceived as more credible when they display these characteristics:**    
            - **Demanding but able to be satisfied:** **Effective leaders get people to make realistic commitments and then hold them responsible for achieving results. But if you’re never satisfied, you’ll sap people’s motivation. Know when to celebrate success and when to push for more.**
