### Chapter 2: Technical Analysis(TA)

- Before you start delving deeper into technical analysis, it is important to set expectations on what can and cannot be achieved with technical analysis.
    1.   Trades – TA is best used to identify short term trades. Do not use TA to identify long term investment opportunities. Long term investment opportunities are best identified using fundamental analysis. Also, If you are a fundamental analyst, use TA to calibrate the entry and exit points.
    2.   Return per trade – TA based trades are usually short term in nature. Do not expect huge returns within a short duration of time. The trick with TA being successful is to identify frequent short-term trading opportunities that can give you small but consistent profits.
    3.   Holding Period – Trades based on technical analysis can last anywhere between few minutes and few weeks, and usually not beyond that. We will explore this aspect when we discuss the topic of timeframes.
    4.   Risk ­– Often, traders initiate a trade for a certain reason; however, in case of an adverse movement in the stock, the trade starts making a loss. Usually, in such situations, traders hold on to their loss-making trade with a hope they can recover the loss. Remember, TA based trades are short term, in case the trade goes sour, do remember to cut the losses and move on to identify another opportunity.

- However, do keep these assumptions in the back of your mind:
    1. **Buy strength and sell weakness** – Strength is represented by a bullish (blue) candle and weakness by a bearish (red) candle. Hence whenever you are buying ensure, it is a blue candle day and whenever you are selling, ensure it’s a red candle day.
    2. **Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify)** – While the textbook definition of a pattern could state certain criteria, there could be minor variations to the pattern owing to market conditions. So one needs to be a bit flexible. However, one needs to be flexible within limits, and hence it is always required to quantify the flexibility.
    3. **Look for a prior trend** – If you are looking at a bullish pattern, the prior trend should be bearish, and likewise, if you are looking for a bearish pattern, the prior trend should be bullish.
  
- **Single Candlestick patterns:**
    - One needs to pay some attention to the length of the candle while trading based on candlestick patterns. The length signifies the range for the day. In general, the longer the candle, the more intense is the buying or selling activity. If the candles are short, it can be concluded that the trading action was subdued.  
    1. **The Marubozu:**
        - A Marubozu is a candlestick with no upper and lower shadow (therefore appearing bald), it has just the real body.
        - Marubozu is probably the only candlestick pattern that violates rule number 3, i.e., looking for a prior trend. A Marubozu can appear anywhere in the chart irrespective of the prior trend; the trading implication remains the same.
        - The red candle represents the bearish marubozu, and the blue represents the bullish marubozu.
        - **A bullish marubozu** indicates that there is so much buying interest in the stock that the market participants were willing to buy the stock at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its high point for the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bullish.
        - The expectation is that with this sudden change in sentiment, there is a surge of bullishness, and this bullish sentiment will continue over the next few trading sessions. Hence a trader should look at buying opportunities with the occurrence of a bullish marubozu. **The buying price should be around the closing price of the marubozu.**
        - Ex. The OHLC data for a marubozu candle is: Open = 971.8, High = 1030.2, Low = 970.1, Close = 1028.4. 
        - Please notice the textbook definition of a marubozu Open = Low, and High = Close. However, in reality, there is a minor variation to this definition. The price variation is not much when measured in percentage terms, for example, the variation between high and close is 1.8, which as a percentage of high is just 0.17%. **This is where the 2nd rule applies – Be flexible, Quantify and Verify.**
        - The **risk-taker would buy the stock on the same day as the marubozu is being formed.** However, the trader needs to validate the occurrence of a marubozu. Validating is quite simple. Indian markets close at 3:30 PM. So, around 3:20 PM one needs to check if the current market price (CMP) is approximately equal to the high price for the day, and the opening price of the day is approximately equal to the low price the day. If this condition is satisfied, you know the day is forming a marubozu, you can buy the stock around the closing price. It is also essential to note that the risk-taker is buying on a bullish/blue candle day, thereby following rule 1, i.e., buying on strength and selling on weakness.
        - The **risk-averse trader would buy the stock on the next day, i.e. the day after the pattern has been formed.** However, before buying the trader, ensure that the day is a bullish day to comply with rule number 1. This means the risk-averse buyer can buy the stock only around the close of the day. The disadvantage of buying the next day is that the buy price is way above the suggested buy price, and therefore the stoploss is quite deep. However, as a trade-off, the risk-averse trader is buying only after doubly confirming that the bullishness is indeed established.
        - In case of a bullish marubozu, the low of the stock acts as a stoploss. **So after you initiate a buy trade, if the markets move in the opposite direction, you should exit the stock if price breaches the low of the marubozu.**       
        - **Booking a loss is a part of the game. Even a seasoned trader goes through this. However, the best part of following the candlestick is that the losses cannot run indefinitely. There is a clear agenda as to what price one has to get out of trade provided the trade starts to move in the opposite direction.**
        - **Of course, there could be instances where the stoploss gets triggered, and you pull out of the trade. But the stock could reverse direction and start going up after you pulled out of the trade. But unfortunately, this is also a part of the game, and one cannot really help it. No matter what happens, the trader should stick to the rules and not find excuses to deviate from it.**
        - Bearish Marubozu indicates extreme bearishness. Here the open is equal to the high and close the is equal to low. Open = High, and Close = Low.
        - **A bearish marubozu** indicates that there is so much selling pressure in the stock that the market participants actually sold at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its low point of the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bearish. **The selling price should be around the closing price of the marubozu.**
        - **Once a trade is initiated, you should hold on to it until either the target is hit or the stoploss is breached. If you attempt to do something else before any one of these event triggers, your trade could most likely go bust. So staying on the course of the plan is extremely crucial.**
        - **The risk-taker can initiate a short trade on the same day around the closing.** Of course, he has to make sure that the candle is forming a bearish marubozu. To do this at 3:20 PM, the trader must confirm if the open is approximately equal to the high and the current market price is equal to the low price. If the condition is validated, then it is a bearish marubozu, a short position can be initiated.
        - **If the trader is risk-averse, he can wait till the next day’s closing.** The short trade will go through only by 3:20 PM next day after ensuring that the day is a red candle day. This is also to ensure that we comply with 1st rule – Buy strength, and Sell weakness.
        - **One should avoid trading during a minimal (below 1% range) or long candle (above 10% range).**
        - A small candle indicates subdued trading activity, and hence it would be difficult to identify the direction of the trade. On the other hand, a long candle indicates extreme activity. The problem with lengthy candles would be the placement of stoploss. The stoploss would be deep, and in case the trade goes wrong, the penalty for paying would be painful. For this reason, one should avoid trading on candles that are either too short or too long.
    
    2. **The Spinning Top** 
        - A spinning top has the following parts:
            1. **Small real body** – This indicates that the open price and close price are quite close. Because the open and close price points are nearby to one another, the colour of the candle does not really matter. It could be a blue or a red candle, what really matters is that the open prices and close prices are near to one another.    
            2. **The upper shadow** – The upper shadow connects the real body to the high point of the day. If it is a red candle, the high and open are connected. If it is a blue candle, the high and close are connected. **This can be treated as an attempt by the bulls to take the markets higher, but they were not really successful at it.**
            3. **The lower shadow** – The lower shadow connects the real body to the low point of the day. If it is a red candle, the low and close are connected. If it is a blue candle, the low and open are connected. **The bears’ attempt to take the markets lower can be treated as an attempt, but they were not really successful.**
        - Now think about the spinning top as a whole along with all its components, i.e. real body, upper shadow, and lower shadow. The bulls made a futile attempt to take the market higher. The bears tried to take the markets lower, and it did not work either. Neither the bulls nor the bears could establish any influence on the market as this is evident with the small real body. Thus Spinning tops are indicative of a market where indecision and uncertainty prevails.
        - If you look at a spinning top in isolation, it does not mean much. It just conveys indecision as both bulls and bears were not able to influence the markets. However, **when you see the spinning top concerning the chart trend, it gives out a compelling message based on which you can position your stance in the markets.**
            1. **Spinning tops in a downtrend** 
                - In a downtrend, the bears are in absolute control as they manage to grind the prices lower. With the spinning top in the downtrend, the bears could be consolidating their position before resuming another bout of selling.
                - There are two foreseeable situations with an equal probability:
                  1. Either there will be another round of selling.
                  2. Or the markets could reverse its directions, and the prices could increase.
                - If the trader has been waiting for an opportunity to go long on the stock, probably this could be his opportunity to do so. However, to play safe, he could test the waters with only half the quantity. If the trader wants to buy 500 shares, he could probably enter the trade with 250 shares and wait and watch the market. If the market reverses its direction, and the prices start going up, then the trader can average up by buying again. If the prices reverse, the trader would most likely have bought the stocks at the lowest prices.
                - If the stock starts to fall, the trader can exit the trade and book a loss. At least the loss is just on half the quantity and not really on the entire quantity.
                - Clearly, **with no clarity on what is likely to happen, the trader needs to be prepared for both the situations, i.e. reversal and continuation.**
                - Think about the spinning top as “The calm before the storm”. The storm could be in the form of a continuation or a reversal of the trend. **In which way, the price will eventually move is not certain; however, what is certain is the movement itself. One needs to be prepared for both situations.**
            2. **Spinning tops in an uptrend**
                - A spinning top in an uptrend has similar implications as the spinning top in a downtrend, except that we look at it slightly differently.
                - The spinning top basically conveys indecision in the market, i.e. neither the bulls nor the bears can influence the markets.
                - Placing the above fact in the context of an uptrend, we can conclude two things(The chances of both these events taking place are equal, i.e. 50%):
                    1. The bulls could be consolidating their position before initiating another leg of the up move.
                    2. Or the bulls are fatigued and may give way to bears. Hence a correction could be around the corner.
        - The spinning top candle shows confusion and indecision in the market with an equal probability of reversal or continuation. **Until the situation becomes clear, the traders should be cautious and minimize their position size.**
    
    3. **The Dojis**
        - The classic definition of a Doji suggests that the open price should be equal to the close price with virtually a non-existent real body. The upper and lower wicks can be of any length.
        - However keeping in mind the 2nd rule, i.e. ‘be flexible, verify and quantify’ even if there is a wafer-thin body, the candle can be considered a Doji.                              
        - The Dojis have similar implications as the spinning top. Whatever we learnt for spinning tops applies to Dojis as well. In fact, more often than not, the dojis and spinning tops appear in a cluster indicating indecision in the market.
    
    4. **Paper Umbrella**
        - The paper umbrella is a single candlestick pattern which helps traders in setting up directional trades. The interpretation of the paper umbrella changes based on where it appears on the chart.
        - A paper umbrella is characterized by a long lower shadow with a small upper body.
        - A paper umbrella consists of two trend reversal patterns, namely the hanging man and the hammer. The hanging man pattern is bearish, and the hammer pattern is relatively bullish.
        - If the paper umbrella appears at the bottom end of a downward rally, it is called the **‘Hammer’.**
        - If the paper umbrella appears at the top end of an uptrend rally, it is called the **‘Hanging Man’.**
        - To qualify a candle as a paper umbrella, the lower shadow’s length should be at least twice the length of the real body. This is called the ‘shadow to real body ratio’.          
        1. **The Hammer formation**
            - The bullish hammer is a significant candlestick pattern that occurs at the bottom of the trend. **A hammer consists of a small real body at the upper end of the trading range with a long lower shadow. The longer, the lower shadow, the more bullish the pattern.**
            - A hammer can be of any colour as it does not really matter as long as it qualifies ‘the shadow to real body’ ratio. However, it is slightly more comforting to see a blue-coloured real body.
            - The prior trend for the hammer should be a downtrend.
            - A hammer formation suggests a long trade.
            - If the trader is a risk-taker, he can buy the stock the same day. Remember, the real body’s colour in hammer does not matter; hence there is no violation of Rule 1. If the trader is risk-averse, he can buy the stock the day after the pattern has formed only after ensuring that the day is a blue candle day.
            - Stoploss for both the traders is the low of the hammer formation.
            - **Please note once you initiate the trade you stay in it until either the stop loss or the target is reached. It would help if you did not tweak the trade until one of these events occurs.**
        2. **The Hanging man**
            - If a paper umbrella appears at the top end of a trend, it is called a Hanging Man. The bearish hanging man is a single candlestick and a top reversal pattern. A hanging man signals a market high. The hanging man is classified as a hanging man only if an uptrend precedes it.   Since the hanging man is seen after a high, the bearish hanging man pattern signals to sell pressure.
            - The hanging man’s prior trend should be an uptrend.
            - The hanging man makes a case for shorting the stock. 
            - For the risk-taker, a short trade can be initiated the same day around the closing price.
            - For the risk-averse, a short trade can be initiated at the close of the next day after ensuring that a red candle would appear.
            - The stoploss price for this trade would be the high price of hanging man formation.
        3. **The shooting star**    
            - The shooting star looks just like an inverted paper umbrella. It has a long upper shadow where the shadow’s length is at least twice the length of the real body.
            - The body’s colour does not matter, but the pattern is slightly more reliable if the real body is red. The longer the upper wick, the more bearish is the pattern.
            - **The shooting star is a bearish pattern; hence the prior trend should be bullish.**
            - The risk-taker initiates the trade the same day after ensuring that the day has formed a shooting star.
            - The risk-averse will initiate the trade on the next day, only after ensuring that the 2nd day a red candle has formed.
            - Once the trade has been initiated, **the stoploss is to be placed at the pattern’s high.**

- **Multiple candlestick patterns**
    - When analyzing multiple candlestick patterns, the trader needs 2 or sometimes 3 candlesticks to identify a trading opportunity. This means the trading opportunity evolves over a minimum of 2 trading sessions.
    1. **The Engulfing Pattern**
        - In a typical engulfing pattern, you will find a small candle on day 1 and a relatively long candle on day 2, which appears as if it engulfs the candle on day 1.
        1. **The Bullish Engulfing Pattern**
            - The bullish engulfing pattern is a two candlestick pattern which appears at the bottom of the downtrend.
            - The prerequisites for the pattern are as follows:
                1. The prior trend should be a downtrend.
                2. The first day of the pattern (P1) should be a red candle reconfirming the bearishness in the market.
                3. The candle on the 2nd day of the pattern (P2) should be blue, long enough to engulf the red candle
            - The suggested buy price is around the close price of the blue candle, i.e. on P2
            - Risk-taker initiates the trade on P2 itself after ensuring P2 is engulfing P1
            - The risk-averse initiates the trade on the next day, i.e. the day after P2 around the closing price, after confirming the day is forming a blue candle
            - The stop loss for the trade would be at the lowest low between P1 and P2
            - As long as the real bodies are engulfed in my personal experience, I would be happy to classify the candle as a bullish engulfing pattern.            
        2. **The bearish engulfing pattern**        
            - The bearish engulfing pattern is a two candlestick pattern that appears at the top end of the trend, making it a bearish pattern. The thought process remains very similar to the bullish engulfing pattern, except one has to think about it from a shorting perspective.
            - The risk-taker initiates the trade on the same day after validating two conditions.
            - The risk-averse will initiate the trade on the day after P2 only after ensuring that it is a red candle day.
            - The stoploss in both cases will be the highest high of P1 and P2.
    2. **The presence of a doji**
        - Charts having doji on day-3(after engulfing pattern) are highly profitable. One should not miss such trading opportunities.
        - Whenever a doji follows a recognizable candlestick pattern, the opportunity created is bigger.        
    3. **The Piercing Pattern(bullish engulfing variation)**        
        - The piercing pattern is very similar to the bullish engulfing pattern with a minor variation. In a bullish engulfing pattern, the P2’s blue candle engulfs P1’s red candle. However in a piercing pattern P2’s blue candle partially engulfs P1’s red candle. However, engulfing should be between 50% and less than 100%.
        - As long as this condition is satisfied, everything else is similar to the bullish engulfing, including the trade set up. Here a risk-taker would initiate the trade on P2 around the close. The risk-averse would initiate the trade, the day after P2 only after ensuring a blue candle is formed. The stoploss would be the low of the pattern.
    4. **The Dark Cloud Cover(bearish engulfing variation)**
        - In a bearish engulfing pattern the red candle on P2 engulfs P1’s blue candle. However, in a dark cloud cover, the red candle on P2 engulfs about 50 to 100% of P1’s blue candle.
    5. **The Harami Pattern(Harami=Pregnant in Japanese)**
        - Harami is a two candle pattern. The first candle is usually long, and the second candle has a small body. The second candle is generally opposite in colour to the first candle. **On the appearance of the harami pattern, a trend reversal is possible.**
        1. **The Bullish Harami** 
            - The price action on P2 creates a small blue candle which appears contained (pregnant) within P1’s long red candle.
            - The idea is to go long on the bullish harami formation.
            - Risk takers can initiate a long trade around the close of the P2 candle.
            - The risk-averse can initiate a long trade at the close of the day after P2, only after confirming that the day is forming a blue candle.
            - The lowest low of the pattern will be the stoploss for the trade.
        2. **The bearish harami**
            - The bearish harami pattern appears at the top end of an uptrend, allowing the trader to initiate a short trade.
            - The risk-taker will short the market near the close of P2 after ensuring P1 and P2 together forms a bearish harami. 
            - The risk-averse will short the market the day after P2 after ensuring it forms a red candle day.
            - The highest high between P1 and P2 acts as the stoploss for the trade.
    6. **The Gaps**
        - **A gap up** opening indicates buyer’s enthusiasm. Buyers are willing to buy stocks at a price higher than the previous day’s close. Hence, the stock (or the index) opens directly above the previous day’s close because of the enthusiastic buyer’s outlook.
        - **A gap down** opening shows the bears’ enthusiasm. The bears are so eager to sell that they are willing to sell at a price lower than the previous day’s close.
    7. **The Morning Star**
        - The morning star is a bullish candlestick pattern which evolves over a three day period. It is a downtrend reversal pattern. The pattern is formed by combining 3 consecutive candlesticks. The morning star appears at the bottom end of a downtrend.
        - The morning star pattern involves 3 candlesticks sequenced in a particular order:- 
            1. On day 1 of the pattern (P1), as expected, the market makes a new low and forms a long red candle. The large red candle shows selling acceleration.
            2. On day 2 of the pattern (P2), the bears show dominance with a gap down opening. This reaffirms the position of the bears. After the gap down opening, nothing much happens during the day (P2) resulting in either a doji or a spinning top. Note the presence of doji/spinning top represents indecision in the market.
            3. On the third day of the pattern (P3), the market/stock opens with a gap, followed by a blue candle that manages to close above P1’s red candle opening.
        - Unlike the single and two candlestick patterns, **both the risk taker and the risk-averse trader can initiate the trade on P3 itself**. 
        - The lowest low in the pattern would act as a stop loss for the trade.
    8. **The Evening Star**
        - The evening star is a bearish equivalent of the morning star. The evening star appears at the top end of an uptrend.
        - The stop loss for the trade will be the highest high of P1, P2, and P3.
    **The stoploss for a long trade is the lowest low of the pattern. The stoploss for a short trade is the highest high of the pattern.**

- **The Support and Resistance**
    - The best way to identify the target price is to identify the support and resistance points. 
    - The support and resistance (S&R) are specific price points on a chart expected to attract the maximum amount of either buying or selling. 
    - **The support price** is a price at which one can expect more buyers than sellers. 
    - Likewise, **the resistance price** is a price at which one can expect more sellers than buyers.
    1. **The Resistance**
        - The resistance level is a price point on the chart where traders expect maximum supply (in terms of selling) for the stock/index. The resistance level is always above the current market price.
        - The resistance price implies there is a likelihood of excess supply.Excess supply builds selling pressure. Selling pressure tends to drag the prices lower.
        - Hence for reasons stated above, when a trader is long, **he can look at resistance points to set targets and to set exit points for the trade.**
    2. **The Support**
        - The support level is a price point on the chart where the trader expects maximum demand (in terms of buying) coming into the stock/index. Whenever the price falls to the support line, it is likely to bounce back. The support level is always below the current market price.
    3. **Construction/Drawing of the Support and Resistance level**                     
        - 4 step guide to help you understand how to identify and construct the support and the resistance line
            1. **Load data points** – If the objective is to identify short term S&R load at least 3-6 months of data points. If you want to identify long term S&R, load at least 12 – 18 months of data points. **Long term S&R** – is useful for swing trading. **Short term S&R** – is useful intraday and BTST trades.
            2. **Identify at least 3 price action zones** - A price action zone can be described as ‘sticky points’ on the chart where the price has displayed at least one of the behaviours:
                - Hesitated to move up further after a brief up move
                - Hesitated to move down further after a brief down move
                - Sharp reversals at a particular price point 
            3. **Align the price action zones** – When you look at a 12-month chart, it is common to spot many price action zones. But the trick is to identify at least 3 price action zones at the same price level. A critical point to note while identifying these price action zones is to make sure these price zones are well spaced in time.
            4. **Fit a horizontal line** – Connect the three price action zones with a horizontal line. Based on where this line fits in concerning the current market price, it either becomes support or resistance.
        - The price level is usually depicted in a range and not at a single price point. It is actually a zone or an area that acts as support or resistance.
    4. **Reliability of S&R**       
        - The support and resistance lines are only indicative of a possible reversal of prices. They by no means should be taken for ascertain. Like anything else in technical analysis, one should weigh the possibility of an event occurring (based on patterns) in terms of probability.
    5. **Optimization and checklist**    
        - The idea is to identify quality trading signals as opposed to identifying plenty but worthless trades.
        
- **Volume**
    - Increases in price + Increases in volume = Bullish
      Increases in price + Decreases in volume = Caution – weak hands buying
      Decreases in price + Increases in volume = Bearish
      Decreases in price + Decreases in volume = Caution – weak hands selling
    - We can qualify increase in volume as follows:-
        High Volume = Today’s volume > last 10 days average volume
        Low Volume = Today’s volume < last 10 days average volume
        Average Volume = Today’s volume = last 10 days average volume
    - **The thought process behind the volume trend table**
        - With all three independent variables, i.e. candlesticks, S&R, and volumes, suggest taking the same action, i.e. to go long. If you realize this is a triple confirmation!
        - I want to drive across the fact that volumes are compelling as it helps the trader confirm a trade.
              
- **Moving Averages**
    - **Simple Moving Average(SMA)**
    - **Exponential Moving Average(EMA)**
        - The average calculated on this scaled set of numbers gives us the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The data points are assigne weightage according to the newness of the data.
        - EMA is quicker to react to the current market price because EMA gives more importance to the most recent data points. 
        - This helps the trader to take quicker trading decisions. Hence, for this reason, traders prefer the use of the EMA over the SMA. 
    - **A simple application of moving average**
        - When the stock price trades above its average price, it means the traders are willing to buy the stock at a price higher than its average price. **This means the traders are optimistic about the stock price going higher**. Therefore one should look at buying opportunities.
        - When the stock price trades below its average price, it means the traders are willing to sell the stock at a price lesser than its average price. **This means the traders are pessimistic about the stock price movement.** Therefore one should look at selling opportunities.
        - This leads us to a significant conclusion about the moving averages. **Moving averages works brilliantly when there is a trend and fails to perform when the stock moves sideways**. This basically means the ‘Moving average’ in its simplest form is a trend following system.
    - **Moving average crossover system**    
        - The plain vanilla moving average system is that it generates far too many trading signals in a sideways market.
        - A moving average crossover system is an improvisation over the plain vanilla moving average system. **It helps the trader to take fewer trades in a sideways market.**
        - Instead of the usual single moving average in a MA crossover system, the trader combines two moving averages. This is usually referred to as **‘smoothing’.**
        - A typical example of this would be to combine a 50 day EMA, with a 100 day EMA. The shorter moving average (50 days in this case) is also referred to as the **faster-moving average.** The longer moving average (100 days moving average) is referred to as the **slower moving average.**
        - The shorter moving average takes a lesser number of data points to calculate the average, and hence it tends to stick closer to the current market price and therefore reacts more quickly. A longer moving average takes more data points to calculate the average, and hence it tends to stay away from the current market price. Hence the reactions are slower.
        - **The trader gets far fewer signals in the process, but the chances of the trade being profitable are quite high.**
        - The entry and exit rules for the crossover system is as stated below:
            - Buy (fresh long) when the short term moving averages turns greater than the long term moving average. Stay in the trade as long as this condition is satisfied
            - Exit the long position (square off) when the short term moving average turns lesser than the longer-term moving average
        - Some of the popular combinations for a swing trader would be:
            - 9 day EMA with 21 days EMA – use this for short term trades ( upto few trading session)
            - 25 day EMA with 50 days EMA – use this to identify medium-term trade (upto few weeks)
            - 50 day EMA with 100 Day EMA – use this to identify trades that lasts upto few months
            - 100 day EMA with 200 days EMA – use this to identify long term trades (investment opportunities), some of them can even last for over a year or more.
        - Remember, longer the time frame, the lesser the number of trading signals.     

- **Indicators**           
    - Indicators are built on preset logic using which traders can supplement their technical study (candlesticks, volumes, S&R) to arrive at a trading decision. Indicators help in buying, selling, confirming trends, and sometimes predicting trends.
    - **Leading indicator leads the price**, meaning it usually signals the occurrence of a reversal or a new trend in advance. While this sounds interesting, you should note, not all leading indicators are accurate. Leading indicators are notorious for giving false signals. Therefore, the trader should be highly alert while using leading indicators. In fact, the efficiency of using leading indicators increases with trading experience.
    - **Lagging indicator lags the price**; meaning it usually signals the occurrence of a reversal or a new trend after it has occurred. One of the most popular lagging indicators is the moving averages.
    - Before we further understand individual indicators, I think it is a good idea to understand what momentum means. **Momentum is the rate at which the price changes.** For example, if the stock price is Rs.100 today and it moves to Rs.105 the next day, and Rs.115, the day after, we say the momentum is high as the stock price has changed by 15% in just 3 days.
    - **Relative Strength Index(RSI)**
        - RSI is a leading momentum indicator which helps in identifying a trend reversal. 
        - RSI indicator oscillates between 0 and 100 and based on the latest indicator reading, the expectations on the markets are set.
        - RSI shows the internal strength of the security, and gives out the strongest signals during the periods of sideways and non-trending ranges.
        - **The objective of using RSI is to help the trader identify oversold and overbought price areas.** Overbought implies that the stock’s positive momentum is so high that it may not be sustainable for long, and hence there could be a correction. Likewise, an oversold position indicates that the negative momentum is high, leading to a possible reversal.
        - When the RSI reading is between 30 and 0, the security is supposed to be oversold and ready for an upward correction. When the security reading is between 70 and 100, the security is supposed to be heavily bought and is ready for a downward correction.
        - The first vertical line marked from left shows a level where RSI is below 30; in fact, RSI is 26.8. Hence RSI suggests that the stock is oversold. In this particular example, the RSI value of 26.8, also coincides with a bullish engulfing pattern. This gives the trader a double confirmation to go long! Needless to say, both volumes and S&R should also conform to this.
        - The second vertical line points to a level where the RSI turns 81, a value which is considered overbought. Hence, if not for looking at shorting opportunities, the trader should be careful in his decision to buy the stock. Again, if you notice the candles, they form a bearish engulfing pattern. A bearish engulfing pattern, backed by an RSI of 81 is a sign to short the stock. What follows this is a quick and a short correction in the stock.
        - This leads us to interpret RSI in many different ways besides the classical interpretation (which we discussed earlier):-
            - **If the RSI is fixed in an overbought region for a prolonged period, look for buying opportunities instead of shorting**. The RSI stays in the overbought region for a prolonged period because of an excess positive momentum.
            - **If the RSI is fixed in an oversold region for a prolonged period, look for selling opportunities rather than buying**. RSI stays in the oversold region for a prolonged period because of an excess negative momentum
            - **If the RSI value starts moving away from the oversold value after a prolonged period, look for buying opportunities**. For example, the RSI moves above 30 after a long time may mean that the stock may have bottomed out, hence a case of going long.
            - **If the RSI value starts moving away from the overbought value after a prolonged period, look for selling opportunities**. For example, RSI moving below 70 after a long time. This means the stock may have topped out, hence a case for shorting.
        - You may choose to use 5,10,20, or even 100 days look back period if you wish too. In fact, this is how you develop your edge as a trader. You need to analyze what works for you and adopt the same. Please note, the fewer the days you use to calculate the RSI, the more volatile the indicator would be.(J.Welles Wilder originally opted to use a lookback period of 14 days)
        - I personally prefer to use 0-20 level and 80-100 to identify oversold and overbought regions respectively. I use this along with the classical 14 days look back period. (J.Welles Wilder decided to use 0-30 to indicate oversold regions and 70-100 level to indicate the overbought region)
    - **Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD)**
        - MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of the two moving averages. **Convergence occurs** when the two moving averages move towards each other, and **divergence occurs** when the moving averages move away.
        - A standard MACD is calculated using a 12 day EMA and a 26 day EMA. Please note, both the EMA’s are based on the closing prices. We subtract the 26 EMA from the 12 day EMA, to estimate the convergence and divergence (CD) value.
        - **MACD value = [12 day EMA – 26 day EMA]**
        - The sign associated with the MACD just indicates the direction of the stock’s move. For example, if the 12 Day EMA is 6380, and 26 Day EMA is 6220, the MACD value is +160. Under what circumstance do you think the 12 day EMA will be greater than the 26 day EMA? When current trend is upwards.
        - A positive sign tells us that there is positive momentum in the stock, and the stock is drifting upwards.
        - The higher the momentum, the higher is the magnitude. For example, +160 indicate a positive trend which is stronger than +120.
        - When the MACD is negative, it means the 12 day EMA is lower than the 26 day EMA. Therefore the momentum is negative. Higher the magnitude of the MACD, the more strength in the downward trend.
        - The difference between the two moving averages is called the MACD spread. The spread decreases when the momentum mellows down and increases when the momentum increases. 
        - As you can see, the MACD line oscillates over a central zero line. This is also called the ‘Centerline’. The basic interpretation of the MACD indicator is:
            1. When the MACD Line crosses the centerline from the negative territory to positive territory, it means there is a divergence between the two averages. This is a sign of increasing bullish momentum; therefore, one should look at buying opportunities.
            2. When the MACD line crosses the centerline from positive territory to the negative territory, it means there is a convergence between the two averages. This is a sign of increasing bearish momentum; therefore, one should look at selling opportunities.
        - Traders generally argue that while waiting for the MACD line to crossover the centerline, a bulk of the movie would already be done and perhaps it would be late to enter a trade.  To overcome this, there is an improvisation over this basic MACD line. The improvisation comes in the form of an additional MACD component which is the 9-day signal line. A 9-day signal line is an exponential moving average (EMA) of the MACD line. If you think about this, we now have two lines:
            1. A MACD line.
            2. A 9 day EMA of the MACD line also called the signal line.
        - **A trader can follow a simple 2 line crossover strategy with these two lines** as discussed in the moving averages chapter and no longer wait for the centerline cross over.
            - The sentiment is bullish when the  MACD line crosses the 9 day EMA wherein MACD line is greater than the 9 days EMA. When this happens, the trader should look at buying opportunities.
            - The sentiment is bearish when the MACD line crosses below the 9 day EMA wherein the MACD line is lesser than the 9 day EMA. When this happens, the trader should look at selling opportunities.
        - At the core of the MACD system, are moving averages. Hence the MACD indicator has similar properties like that of a moving average system. They work quite well when there is a strong trend and are not too useful when moving sideways.
    - **The Bollinger Bands(BB)**    
        - BB is used to determine overbought and oversold levels, where a trader will try to sell when the price reaches the top of the band and will execute a buy when the price reaches the bottom of the band.
        - The BB has 3 components:
            1. The middle line which is The 20 day simple moving average of the closing prices
            2. An upper band – this is the +2 standard deviation of the middle line
            3. A lower band – this is the -2 standard deviation of the middle line
        - The standard deviation (SD) is a statistical concept; which measures a particular variable’s variance from its average.
        - In BB, the standard deviation is applied on the 20 days SMA. The upper band indicates the +2 SD. **Using a +2 SD, we multiply the SD by 2 and add it to the average.**
        - The upper and lower bands act as a trigger to initiate a trade. The idea is to short the stock when the price touches the upper band, expecting it to revert to average. Likewise, one can go long when the price touches the lower band, expecting it to revert to the average.
        - The BB’s upper and lower band together forms an envelope. The envelope expands, whenever the price drifts in a particular direction, indicating strong momentum. **The BB signal fails when there is an envelope expansion. This leads us to an important conclusion; BB works well in sideways markets and fails in a trending market.**
    - **Ideology**
        - Imagine a situation where you are looking at an opportunity to buy shares of Karnataka Bank Limited. On a particular day, Karnataka Bank has formed a bullish hammer, assume everything ticks on the checklist:
            - Bullish hammer is a recognizable candlestick pattern
            - The low of the bullish hammer also coincides with the support
            - The volumes are above average
            - There is also a MACD crossover (signal line turns greater than the MACD line)
        - With all four checklist points being ticked off I would be happy to buy Karnataka Bank. Hence I place an order to buy, let us say for 500 shares.      
        - However, imagine a situation where the first 3 checklist conditions are met, but the 4th condition (indicators should confirm) is not satisfied. What do you think I should do? I would still go ahead and buy, but instead of 500 shares, I’d probably buy 300 shares. This should hopefully convey to you how I tend to (and advocate) the use of indicators.
        - When Indicators confirm, I increase my bet size, but when Indicators don’t confirm I still go ahead with my decision to buy, I scale down my bet size.
        - However, I would not do this with the first three checklist points. For example, if the low of the bullish hammer does not coincide in and around the support, I’ll really reconsider my plan to buy the stock; in fact, I may skip the opportunity, and look for another opportunity.
        - But I do not treat the indicators with the same conviction. It is always good to know what indicators convey, but I don’t base my decisions. If the indicators confirm, I increase the bet size; if they don’t, I still go ahead with my original game plan.    

- **The Fibonacci Retracements**                              
    - There are few interesting properties of the Fibonacci series.
        - Divide any number in the series by the previous number; the ratio is always approximately 1.618. The ratio of 1.618 is considered as the Golden Ratio, also referred to as the Phi.
        - Further into the ratio properties, one can find remarkable consistency when a number is in the Fibonacci series is divided by its immediate succeeding number. At this stage, do bear in mind that 0.618, when expressed in percentage is 61.8%.
        - Similar consistency can be found when any number in the Fibonacci series is divided by a number two places higher. 0.382, when expressed in percentage terms, is 38.2%
        - Also, consistency is when a number in the Fibonacci series is divided by a number 3 place higher. 0.236, when expressed in percentage terms, is 23.6%.
    - Whenever the stock moves either upwards or downwards sharply, it usually tends to retrace back before its next move. For example, if the stock has run up from Rs.50 to Rs.100, it is likely to retrace back to probably Rs.70 before moving Rs.120.
    - **‘The retracement level forecast’ is a technique that can identify upto which level retracement can happen.** These retracement levels provide a good opportunity for the traders to enter new positions in the trend direction.  The Fibonacci ratios, i.e. 61.8%, 38.2%, and 23.6%, help the trader identify the retracement’s possible extent.
    - I would now define the move of 109 (380 – 489) as the Fibonacci upmove.  As per the Fibonacci retracement theory, after the upmove one can anticipate a correction in the stock to last up to the Fibonacci ratios. For example, the first level up to which the stock can correct could be 23.6%. If this stock continues to correct further, the trader can watch out for the 38.2% and 61.8% levels.
    - **How should you use the Fibonacci retracement levels**
        - Use the Fibonacci retracement tool to connect the immediate trough and the peak.
        - By plotting the Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader can identify these retracement levels, and therefore position himself for an opportunity to enter the trade. However please note like any indicator, use the Fibonacci retracement as a confirmation tool.
    
- **The Dow Theory**
    - **The Dow Theory Principles**
        - The Dow Theory is built on a few beliefs called the Dow Theory tenets. 9 tenets are considered:-
            1. **Indices discounts everything:**	The stock market indices discount everything which is known & unknown in the public domain. If a sudden and unexpected event occurs, the stock market indices quickly recalibrate itself to reflect the accurate value
            2. **Overall there are 3 broad market trends:**	Primary Trend, Secondary Trend, and Minor Trends
            3. **The Primary Trend:**	This is the major trend of the market that lasts from a year to several years. It indicates the broader multiyear direction of the market. While the long term investor is interested in the primary trend, an active trader is interested in all trends. The primary trend could be a primary uptrend or a primary downtrend
            4. **The Secondary Trend:**	These are corrections to the primary trend. Think of this as a minor counter-reaction to the larger movement in the market. Example – corrections in the bull market, rallies & recoveries in the bear market. The counter-trend can last anywhere between a few weeks to several months
            5. **Minor Trends/Daily fluctuations:**	These are daily fluctuations in the market; some traders prefer to call them market noise
            6. **All Indices must confirm with each other:**	We cannot confirm a trend based on just one index. For example, the market is bullish only if CNX Nifty, CNX Nifty Midcap, CNX Nifty Smallcap etc. all move in the same upward direction. It would not be possible to classify markets as bullish, just by the action of CNX Nifty alone
            7. **Volumes must confirm:**	The volumes must confirm along with the price. The trend should be supported by volume. The volume must increase as the price rises and should reduce as the price falls in an uptrend. In a downtrend, the volume must increase when the price falls and decrease when the price rises. You could refer chapter 12 for more details on volume
            8. **Sideway markets can substitute secondary markets:**	Markets may remain sideways (trading between a range) for an extended period. Example:- Reliance Industries between 2010 and 2013 was trading between 860 and 990. The sideways markets can be a substitute for a secondary trend
            9. **The closing price is the most sacred:**	Between the open, high, low and close prices, the close is the most important price level as it represents the final evaluation of the stock during the day.
    - Dow Theory suggests the markets are made up of three distinct phases, which are self-repeating. These are called the Accumulation phase, the Markup phase, and the Distribution phase.
        1. **The Accumulation phase** usually occurs right after a steep sell-off in the market. The steep sell-off in the markets would have frustrated many market participants, losing hope of any uptrend in prices. The stock prices would have plummeted to rock bottom valuations, but the buyers would still be hesitant to buy fearing another sell-off. Hence the stock price languishes at low levels. This is when the ‘Smart Money’ enters the market.
        2. Once the institutional investors (smart money) absorb all the available stocks, short term traders since the support. This usually coincides with the improved business sentiment. These factors tend to take the stock price higher. **This is called the markup phase**. During the Markup phase, the stock price rallies quickly and sharply. The most important feature of the markup phase is speed. Because the rally is quick, the public at large is left out of the rally. New investors are mesmerized by the return, and everyone from the analysts to the public sees higher levels ahead.
        3. Finally, when the stock price reaches new highs (52 weeks high, all-time high), everyone around would be talking about the stock market. By and large, the public wants to get involved in the markets as there is a positive sentiment. This is when the **distribution phase occurs**. The judicious investors (smart investors) who got in early (during the accumulation phase) will start offloading their shares slowly. The public will absorb all the volumes offloaded by the institutional investors (smart money) there by giving them the well-needed price support. The distribution phase has similar price properties as that of the accumulation phase.
    - Some of the patterns that we will study are:
        1. **The Double bottom & Double top formation**
            - A double top & double bottom is considered a reversal pattern. A double bottom occurs when a stock’s price hits a shallow price level and rebounds back with a quick recovery. Following the price recovery, the stock trades at a higher level (relative to the low price) for at least 2 weeks (well spaced in time). After which the stock attempts to hit back to the low price previously made. If the stock holds up once again and rebounds, then a double bottom is formed.
            - A double bottom formation is considered bullish.
            - Likewise, in a double top formation, the stock attempts to hit the same high price twice but eventually sells off. Of course, the time gap between the two attempts of crossing the high should at least be 2 weeks.
        2. **The Triple Bottom & Triple Top**
            - A triple formation is similar to a double formation, except that the price level is tested thrice as opposed twice in a double bottom. The interpretation of the triple formation is similar to the double formation.
            - As a rule of thumb, the more number of times the price tests, and reacts to a certain price level, the more sacred the price level is considered. Therefore by this, the triple formation is considered more powerful than the double formation.
        3. **Range formation**
            - **Sideways Market:** The stock attempts to hit the same upper and lower price level multiple times for an extended period of time in a range. 
            - As the price oscillates in a narrow range without forming a particular trend, it is called **a sideways market or sideways drift**. So, when both the buyers and sellers are not confident about the market direction, the price would typically move in a range. 
            - The range provides multiple opportunities to trade both ways (long and short) with reasonable accuracy for a short term trader. The upside is capped by resistance and the downside by the support. **This it is known as a range-bound market or a trading market as there are enough opportunities for both the buyers and the sellers**.
            - Stocks can trade in the range for two reasons:
                1. When there are no meaningful fundamental triggers that can move the stock.(quarterly/ annual result announcements, new product launches)
                2. When the market anticipates a big corporate announcement, the stock can swing in either direction based on the announcement’s outcome. Till the announcement is made both buyers and sellers would be hesitant to take action, and hence the stock gets into the range.
            - The range breakout more often than not indicates the start of a new trend. **What is more important is the breakout itself, and the trading opportunity it provides.**
            - A trader will take a long position when the stock price breaks the resistance levels and will go short after the support level breaks.                
            - **A false breakout** happens when the trigger is not strong enough to pull the stock in a particular direction. Loosely put, a false breakout happens when a ‘not so trigger friendly event’ occurs, and impatient retail market participants react to it. Usually, the volumes are low on false range breakouts indicating; there is no smart money involved in the move. After a false breakout, the stock usually falls back within the range.
            - **A true breakout** has two distinct characteristics: **Volumes are high and the momentum (rate of change of price) is high.**
            - Traders buy the stock as soon as the stock breaks out of the range on good volumes. Good volumes confirm just one of the prerequisite of the range breakout. However, there is no way for the trader to figure out if the momentum (second prerequisite) will continue to build. Hence, the trader should always have a stoploss for range breakout trades. 
            - **After initiating the trade, if the breakout is genuine, then the trader can expect a move in the stock that is at least equivalent to the range’s width.**
        4. **Flag formation**
            - With these two events (i.e. price rally, and price decline) occurring consecutively a flag formation is formed. When a flag forms, the stock invariably spurts back suddenly and continues to rally upwards.
            - The logic behind the flag formation is fairly simple. The steep rally in the stock offers an opportunity for market participants to book profits. Invariably, the retail participants who are happy with the recent stock gains start booking profits by selling the stock. This leads to a decline in the stock price.  As only the retail participants are selling, the volumes are on the lower side. The smart money is still invested in the stock, and hence the sentiment is positive for the stock. Many traders see this as an opportunity to buy the stock, and hence the price rallies all of a sudden.
    - **The Reward to Risk Ratio (RRR)**
        - The minimum RRR threshold should be set by each trader based on his/her risk appetite. For instance, personally, I wouldn’t say I like to take up trades with a RRR of less than 1.5. Ultra cautious traders would prefer their RRR to be upwards of 2, meaning for every Rs.1/- of risk they would expect at least Rs.2 as a reward.
        - **Remember, a low RRR is just not worth the trade. Ultimately if RRR is not satisfied, then even a trade that looks attractive must be dropped as it is just not worth the risk.**
        
- If you are starting fresh or not a seasoned trader, I suggest you avoid day trading. Start with trades to hold the trade for a few days. This is called **‘Positional Trading’ or ‘Swing Trading’**. An active swing trader usually keeps his trading position open for a few days. The best lookback period for a swing trader is 6 months to 1 year.
- On the other hand, a scalper is a seasoned day trader; typically, he uses 1minute or 5 minutes timeframe.
- Once you are comfortable with holding trades over multiple days, graduate yourself to ‘Day Trading’.    
- For swing trading opportunities, a trader should look for at least 6 months to 1-year data. Likewise, a scalper is better off looking at the last 5 days data.
- However, while plotting the S&R levels, you should increase the look back period to at least 2 years.
    
- ***Trading Checklist***
    - Discipline, they say makes up for the 80% of the trader’s success. In my opinion, the checklist forces you to be disciplined; it helps you avoid taking an abrupt and reckless trading decision.
        1. The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern.
        2. S&R should confirm to the trade. The stoploss price should be around S&R.
            1. For a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support.
            2. For a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance.
        3. Volumes should confirm
            1. Ensure above average volumes on both buy and sell day
            2. Low volumes are not encouraging, and hence do feel free to hesitate while taking trade where the volumes are low.
        4. Look at the trade from the Dow Theory perspective.
            1. Primary, secondary trends
            2. Double, triple, range formations
            3. Recognisable Dow formation
        5. Indicators should confirm
            1. Scale the trade size higher if indicators confirm to your plan of action
            2. If the indicators do not confirm go ahead with the original plan
        6. RRR should be satisfactory
            1. Think about your risk appetite and identify your RRR threshold
            2. For a complete beginner, I would suggest the RRR be as high as possible as this provides a margin of safety.
            3. For an active trader, I would suggest a RRR of at least 1.5
    
- ***The Scout***
    - We have now set the 4 important aspects:
        1. The charting software – TradingView
        2. Timeframe – End of Day data
        3. Opportunity Universe – Nifty 50 stocks
        4. Trade type – Positional trades with an option to square off intraday, provided the target hits the same day.
        5. Look back period – Between 6 months to 1 year. Increase to 2 years while plotting the S&R level
    - **The Shortlisting process**
        1. I look at the chart of all the stocks within my opportunity universe.
        2. While looking at the chart, my attention is only on the recent 3 or maximum of 4 candles
        3. While looking at the recent 3 candles, I check if any recognisable candlestick pattern is developed.
        4. If I find an interesting pattern, I shortlist this stock for further investigation, and I continue the scouting process. I always ensure I check all the 50 charts.
    - **The Evaluation process**
        - At this stage, I am usually left with 4-5 shortlisted stocks (out of the 50 stocks in my opportunity universe) which exhibit a recognisable candlestick pattern. I then proceed to evaluate these 4-5 charts in detail. Typically I spend at least 15 – 20 minutes on each chart. Here is what I do when looking at the shortlisted chart:
        1. I generally look at how strong the pattern is – I am specifically interested in checking if there is any need for me to be more flexible. For example, if a Bullish Marubuzo has a shadow, I evaluate the shadow’s length concerning the range.
        2. After this, I look at the ‘prior trend’. For all bullish patterns, the prior trend should be a downtrend, and for all bearish patterns, the prior trend should be an uptrend. I do pay a lot of attention to prior trends.
        3. At this stage, if everything looks good (i.e. I have identified a recognizable pattern with a well defined prior trend), I proceed to inspect the chart further.
        4. After this, I look at the volumes. The volume should be at least equal to or more than the 10-day average volume.
        5. Provided both the candlestick pattern and volumes confirm, I then check the support (in case of a long trade) and resistance (in case of a short trade) level.
            1. The S&R level should coincide (as much as possible) with the stoploss of the trade (as defined by the candlestick pattern)
            2. If the S&R level is more than 4% away from the stoploss, I stop evaluating the chart further and proceed to the next chart.
        6. I then look for Dow patterns, particularly for double and triple top & bottom formations, flags formations, and a range breakout possibility.
            1. Needless to say, I also establish the Primary and secondary market trend.
        7. If the steps 1 to 5 are satisfactory, I proceed to calculate the risk to reward ratio (RRR)
            1. To calculate RRR, I first establish the target by plotting either the support or resistance level.
            2. The minimum RRR should be at least 1.5
        8. Finally, I look at the MACD and RSI indicators to get a perspective if they confirm, and if I have spare cash, I increase my trade size.
        - Usually out of the 4-5 shortlisted stocks, at the most 1 or 2 may qualify for a trade. There are days when there are no trading opportunities. Deciding not to trade in itself is a big trading decision. Remember this is a fairly stringent checklist; if a stock is confirming the checklist, my conviction to trade is very high.
