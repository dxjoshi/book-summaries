### Chapter 2: Technical Analysis(TA)

- Before you start delving deeper into technical analysis, it is important to set expectations on what can and cannot be achieved with technical analysis.
    1.   Trades – TA is best used to identify short term trades. Do not use TA to identify long term investment opportunities. Long term investment opportunities are best identified using fundamental analysis. Also, If you are a fundamental analyst, use TA to calibrate the entry and exit points.
    2.   Return per trade – TA based trades are usually short term in nature. Do not expect huge returns within a short duration of time. The trick with TA being successful is to identify frequent short-term trading opportunities that can give you small but consistent profits.
    3.   Holding Period – Trades based on technical analysis can last anywhere between few minutes and few weeks, and usually not beyond that. We will explore this aspect when we discuss the topic of timeframes.
    4.   Risk ­– Often, traders initiate a trade for a certain reason; however, in case of an adverse movement in the stock, the trade starts making a loss. Usually, in such situations, traders hold on to their loss-making trade with a hope they can recover the loss. Remember, TA based trades are short term, in case the trade goes sour, do remember to cut the losses and move on to identify another opportunity.

- However, do keep these assumptions in the back of your mind:
  1. **Buy strength and sell weakness** – Strength is represented by a bullish (blue) candle and weakness by a bearish (red) candle. Hence whenever you are buying ensure, it is a blue candle day and whenever you are selling, ensure it’s a red candle day.
  2. **Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify)** – While the textbook definition of a pattern could state certain criteria, there could be minor variations to the pattern owing to market conditions. So one needs to be a bit flexible. However, one needs to be flexible within limits, and hence it is always required to quantify the flexibility.
  3. **Look for a prior trend** – If you are looking at a bullish pattern, the prior trend should be bearish, and likewise, if you are looking for a bearish pattern, the prior trend should be bullish.
  
- **Single Candlestick patterns:**
  - One needs to pay some attention to the length of the candle while trading based on candlestick patterns. The length signifies the range for the day. In general, the longer the candle, the more intense is the buying or selling activity. If the candles are short, it can be concluded that the trading action was subdued.  
  1. **The Marubozu:**
        - A Marubozu is a candlestick with no upper and lower shadow (therefore appearing bald), it has just the real body.
        - Marubozu is probably the only candlestick pattern that violates rule number 3, i.e., looking for a prior trend. A Marubozu can appear anywhere in the chart irrespective of the prior trend; the trading implication remains the same.
        - The red candle represents the bearish marubozu, and the blue represents the bullish marubozu.
        - **A bullish marubozu** indicates that there is so much buying interest in the stock that the market participants were willing to buy the stock at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its high point for the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bullish.
        - The expectation is that with this sudden change in sentiment, there is a surge of bullishness, and this bullish sentiment will continue over the next few trading sessions. Hence a trader should look at buying opportunities with the occurrence of a bullish marubozu. **The buying price should be around the closing price of the marubozu.**
        - Ex. The OHLC data for a marubozu candle is: Open = 971.8, High = 1030.2, Low = 970.1, Close = 1028.4. 
        - Please notice the textbook definition of a marubozu Open = Low, and High = Close. However, in reality, there is a minor variation to this definition. The price variation is not much when measured in percentage terms, for example, the variation between high and close is 1.8, which as a percentage of high is just 0.17%. **This is where the 2nd rule applies – Be flexible, Quantify and Verify.**
        - The **risk-taker would buy the stock on the same day as the marubozu is being formed.** However, the trader needs to validate the occurrence of a marubozu. Validating is quite simple. Indian markets close at 3:30 PM. So, around 3:20 PM one needs to check if the current market price (CMP) is approximately equal to the high price for the day, and the opening price of the day is approximately equal to the low price the day. If this condition is satisfied, you know the day is forming a marubozu, you can buy the stock around the closing price. It is also essential to note that the risk-taker is buying on a bullish/blue candle day, thereby following rule 1, i.e., buying on strength and selling on weakness.
        - The **risk-averse trader would buy the stock on the next day, i.e. the day after the pattern has been formed.** However, before buying the trader, ensure that the day is a bullish day to comply with rule number 1. This means the risk-averse buyer can buy the stock only around the close of the day. The disadvantage of buying the next day is that the buy price is way above the suggested buy price, and therefore the stoploss is quite deep. However, as a trade-off, the risk-averse trader is buying only after doubly confirming that the bullishness is indeed established.
        - In case of a bullish marubozu, the low of the stock acts as a stoploss. **So after you initiate a buy trade, if the markets move in the opposite direction, you should exit the stock if price breaches the low of the marubozu.**       
        - **Booking a loss is a part of the game. Even a seasoned trader goes through this. However, the best part of following the candlestick is that the losses cannot run indefinitely. There is a clear agenda as to what price one has to get out of trade provided the trade starts to move in the opposite direction.**
        - **Of course, there could be instances where the stoploss gets triggered, and you pull out of the trade. But the stock could reverse direction and start going up after you pulled out of the trade. But unfortunately, this is also a part of the game, and one cannot really help it. No matter what happens, the trader should stick to the rules and not find excuses to deviate from it.**
        - Bearish Marubozu indicates extreme bearishness. Here the open is equal to the high and close the is equal to low. Open = High, and Close = Low.
        - **A bearish marubozu** indicates that there is so much selling pressure in the stock that the market participants actually sold at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its low point of the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bearish. **The selling price should be around the closing price of the marubozu.**
        - **Once a trade is initiated, you should hold on to it until either the target is hit or the stoploss is breached. If you attempt to do something else before any one of these event triggers, your trade could most likely go bust. So staying on the course of the plan is extremely crucial.**
        - **The risk-taker can initiate a short trade on the same day around the closing.** Of course, he has to make sure that the candle is forming a bearish marubozu. To do this at 3:20 PM, the trader must confirm if the open is approximately equal to the high and the current market price is equal to the low price. If the condition is validated, then it is a bearish marubozu, a short position can be initiated.
        - **If the trader is risk-averse, he can wait till the next day’s closing.** The short trade will go through only by 3:20 PM next day after ensuring that the day is a red candle day. This is also to ensure that we comply with 1st rule – Buy strength, and Sell weakness.
        - **One should avoid trading during a minimal (below 1% range) or long candle (above 10% range).**
        - A small candle indicates subdued trading activity, and hence it would be difficult to identify the direction of the trade. On the other hand, a long candle indicates extreme activity. The problem with lengthy candles would be the placement of stoploss. The stoploss would be deep, and in case the trade goes wrong, the penalty for paying would be painful. For this reason, one should avoid trading on candles that are either too short or too long.
  
  2. **The Spinning Top** 
        - A spinning top has the following parts:
            1. **Small real body** – This indicates that the open price and close price are quite close. Because the open and close price points are nearby to one another, the colour of the candle does not really matter. It could be a blue or a red candle, what really matters is that the open prices and close prices are near to one another.    
            2. **The upper shadow** – The upper shadow connects the real body to the high point of the day. If it is a red candle, the high and open are connected. If it is a blue candle, the high and close are connected. **This can be treated as an attempt by the bulls to take the markets higher, but they were not really successful at it.**
            3. **The lower shadow** – The lower shadow connects the real body to the low point of the day. If it is a red candle, the low and close are connected. If it is a blue candle, the low and open are connected. **The bears’ attempt to take the markets lower can be treated as an attempt, but they were not really successful.**
        - Now think about the spinning top as a whole along with all its components, i.e. real body, upper shadow, and lower shadow. The bulls made a futile attempt to take the market higher. The bears tried to take the markets lower, and it did not work either. Neither the bulls nor the bears could establish any influence on the market as this is evident with the small real body. Thus Spinning tops are indicative of a market where indecision and uncertainty prevails.
        - If you look at a spinning top in isolation, it does not mean much. It just conveys indecision as both bulls and bears were not able to influence the markets. However, **when you see the spinning top concerning the chart trend, it gives out a compelling message based on which you can position your stance in the markets.**
            1. **Spinning tops in a downtrend** 
                - In a downtrend, the bears are in absolute control as they manage to grind the prices lower. With the spinning top in the downtrend, the bears could be consolidating their position before resuming another bout of selling.
                - There are two foreseeable situations with an equal probability:
                  1. Either there will be another round of selling.
                  2. Or the markets could reverse its directions, and the prices could increase.
                - If the trader has been waiting for an opportunity to go long on the stock, probably this could be his opportunity to do so. However, to play safe, he could test the waters with only half the quantity. If the trader wants to buy 500 shares, he could probably enter the trade with 250 shares and wait and watch the market. If the market reverses its direction, and the prices start going up, then the trader can average up by buying again. If the prices reverse, the trader would most likely have bought the stocks at the lowest prices.
                - If the stock starts to fall, the trader can exit the trade and book a loss. At least the loss is just on half the quantity and not really on the entire quantity.
                - Clearly, **with no clarity on what is likely to happen, the trader needs to be prepared for both the situations, i.e. reversal and continuation.**
                - Think about the spinning top as “The calm before the storm”. The storm could be in the form of a continuation or a reversal of the trend. **In which way, the price will eventually move is not certain; however, what is certain is the movement itself. One needs to be prepared for both situations.**
            2. **Spinning tops in an uptrend**
                - A spinning top in an uptrend has similar implications as the spinning top in a downtrend, except that we look at it slightly differently.
                - The spinning top basically conveys indecision in the market, i.e. neither the bulls nor the bears can influence the markets.
                - Placing the above fact in the context of an uptrend, we can conclude two things(The chances of both these events taking place are equal, i.e. 50%):
                    1. The bulls could be consolidating their position before initiating another leg of the up move.
                    2. Or the bulls are fatigued and may give way to bears. Hence a correction could be around the corner.
        - The spinning top candle shows confusion and indecision in the market with an equal probability of reversal or continuation. **Until the situation becomes clear, the traders should be cautious and minimize their position size.**
  
  3. **The Dojis**
        - The classic definition of a Doji suggests that the open price should be equal to the close price with virtually a non-existent real body. The upper and lower wicks can be of any length.
        - However keeping in mind the 2nd rule, i.e. ‘be flexible, verify and quantify’ even if there is a wafer-thin body, the candle can be considered a Doji.                              
        - The Dojis have similar implications as the spinning top. Whatever we learnt for spinning tops applies to Dojis as well. In fact, more often than not, the dojis and spinning tops appear in a cluster indicating indecision in the market.

  4. **Paper Umbrella**
        - The paper umbrella is a single candlestick pattern which helps traders in setting up directional trades. The interpretation of the paper umbrella changes based on where it appears on the chart.
        - A paper umbrella is characterized by a long lower shadow with a small upper body.
        - A paper umbrella consists of two trend reversal patterns, namely the hanging man and the hammer. The hanging man pattern is bearish, and the hammer pattern is relatively bullish.
        - If the paper umbrella appears at the bottom end of a downward rally, it is called the **‘Hammer’.**
        - If the paper umbrella appears at the top end of an uptrend rally, it is called the **‘Hanging Man’.**
        - To qualify a candle as a paper umbrella, the lower shadow’s length should be at least twice the length of the real body. This is called the ‘shadow to real body ratio’.          
        1. **The Hammer formation**
            - The bullish hammer is a significant candlestick pattern that occurs at the bottom of the trend. **A hammer consists of a small real body at the upper end of the trading range with a long lower shadow. The longer, the lower shadow, the more bullish the pattern.**
            - A hammer can be of any colour as it does not really matter as long as it qualifies ‘the shadow to real body’ ratio. However, it is slightly more comforting to see a blue-coloured real body.
            - The prior trend for the hammer should be a downtrend.
