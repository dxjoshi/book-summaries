- **Chapter-1: Don’t Try**    
    - The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.     
    - **The Feedback Loop from Hell:** You’re so worried about doing the right thing all the time that you become worried about how much you’re worrying. Or you feel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you’re feeling. Or you get sad and alone so often that it makes you feel even more sad and alone just thinking about it.
    - By not giving a fuck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell; you say to yourself, “I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck?” And then, as if sprinkled by magic fuckgiving fairy dust, you stop hating yourself for feeling so bad.
    - **The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.** 
    - Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.
    - So what does not giving a fuck mean? Let’s look at three “subtleties” that should help clarify the matter.
        - **Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.**
        - **To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.**     
        - **Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.**     
    
- **Chapter-2: Happiness Is a Problem**    
    - Years later, the prince would build his own philosophy and share it with the world, and this would be its first and central tenet: **that pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them**. The prince would later become known as the Buddha.      
    - Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is “solving.” If you’re avoiding your problems or feel like you don’t have any problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can’t solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable. **The secret sauce is in the solving of the problems, not in not having problems in the first place.**     
    - **Negative emotions are a call to action**. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something. **Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action**. When you feel them, life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it. **Then, like everything else, the positive emotions go away, because more problems inevitably emerge**. 
    - Psychologists sometimes refer to this concept as the “hedonic treadmill”: the idea that we’re always working hard to change our life situation, but we actually never feel very different. **This is why our problems are recursive and unavoidable**. The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. **The dream job you take is the job you stress over**.   
    - Despite my fantasizing about this for over half my lifetime, the reality never came to fruition. And it took me a long time and a lot of struggle to finally figure out why: I didn’t actually want it. **I was in love with the result—the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I was playing—but I wasn’t in love with the process**. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. Hell, I didn’t even try hard enough to fail at it. I hardly tried at all. **I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way.**     
    - **People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it.**      
    
- **Chapter-3: You Are Not Special**    
    - Often, it’s this realization—**that you and your problems are actually not privileged in their severity or pain**—that is the first and most important step toward solving them.      
    - The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, **they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all**. It’s anti-entitlement. **People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better**.      
    
- **Chapter-4: The Value of Suffering** 
    - the first layer of the selfawareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions. “This is when I feel happy.” “This makes me feel sad.” “This gives me hope.”        
    - The second layer of the selfawareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions.    
    - The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?   
    - **Shitty Values:**
        - Pleasure is great, but it’s a horrible value to prioritize your life around. Ask any drug addict how his pursuit of pleasure turned out. 
          **Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; rather**, it is the effect. If you get the other stuff right (the other values and metrics), then pleasure will naturally occur as a by-product.
        - **Material Success:** Once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero. 
        - **Always Being Right:** As humans, we’re wrong pretty much constantly, so if your metric for life success is to be right —well, you’re going to have a difficult time rationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself.  
        - **Staying Positive:** Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life’s problems— problems which, by the way, if you’re choosing the right values and metrics, should be invigorating you and motivating you. 
          Things go wrong, people upset us, accidents happen. These things make us feel like shit. And that’s fine. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health. To deny that negativity is to perpetuate problems rather than solve them.  
          The trick with negative emotions is to 
            - Express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and
            - Express them in a way that aligns with your values. 
        - Freud once said, “**One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.**” This is why these values—pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive—are poor ideals for a person’s life. Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive.
    - Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable.
    - Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable.   
    - As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.   
    - When we have poor values—that is, poor standards we set for ourselves and others—**we are essentially giving fucks about the things that don’t matter, things that in fact make our life worse**. But when we choose better values, we are able to divert our fucks to something better—toward things that matter, things that improve the state of our well-being and that generate happiness, pleasure, and success as side effects.    
    - The rest of this book is dedicated to five counterintuitive values that I believe are the most beneficial values one can adopt. All require confronting deeper problems rather than avoiding them through highs. These five values are both unconventional and uncomfortable but are lifechanging.
      1. Taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault. 
      2. **Uncertainty:** the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs.
      3. **Failure:** the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. 
      4. **Rejection:** the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life.
      5. **Contemplation:** of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.      
    
- **Chapter-5: You Are Always Choosing**
    - Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful **is a sense that we chose it, and that we are responsible for it**.  
    
- **Chapter-6: You’re Wrong About Everything (But So Am I)**        
    - Growth is an endlessly iterative process. **When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong**.  
    - **Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time**. Because we are.   
    
- **Chapter-7: Failure Is the Way Forward**        
    - **Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you’ve failed at something**. If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have.     
    - The reason for Picasso’s success is exactly the same reason why, as an old man, he was happy to scribble drawings on a napkin alone in a café. His underlying value was simple and humble. **And it was endless. It was the value “honest expression.”**  
    - **Pain Is Part of the Process:** 
        - Dabrowski argued that fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, **they are often representative of the necessary pain of psychological growth**. And to deny that pain is to deny our own potential. **Just as one must suffer physical pain to build stronger bone and muscle, one must suffer emotional pain to develop greater emotional resilience, a stronger sense of self, increased compassion, and a generally happier life**.    
        - Learn to sustain the pain you’ve chosen. When you choose a new value, you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Then act despite it.    
    - **The “Do Something” Principle:**
        - Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it.    
        - The thing about motivation is that it’s not only a three-part chain, but an endless loop:     
          Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Etc.      
          Your actions create further emotional reactions and inspirations and move on to motivate your future actions.     
                  
- **Chapter-8: The Importance of Saying No**    
    - **Freedom grants the opportunity for greater meaning, but by itself there is nothing necessarily meaningful about it**. Ultimately, the only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one’s life is through a rejection of alternatives, a narrowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or (gulp) one person.        
    - Yes, breadth of experience is likely necessary and desirable when you’re young—after all, you have to go out there and discover what seems worth investing yourself in. But depth is where the gold is buried. And you have to stay committed to something and go deep to dig it up. That’s true in relationships, in a career, in building a great lifestyle—in everything.      
    
- **Chapter-9: And Then You Die**   
    - The Denial of Death book essentially makes two points:    
        - Humans are unique in that we’re the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly. Because we’re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the only animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it. This realization causes what Becker calls “death terror,” a deep existential anxiety that underlies everything we think or do.   
        - We essentially have two “selves.” The first self is the physical self—the one that eats, sleeps, snores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self— our identity, or how we see ourselves.    
          Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever. This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues, on spines of books.     
          While death is bad, it is inevitable. Therefore, we should not avoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can. Because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.        
    - **"The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” - Mark Twain**
