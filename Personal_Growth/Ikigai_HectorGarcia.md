- ***IKIGAI***
    - Having a clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to our lives.
    - According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations.
    - Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation. They don’t do strenuous exercise, but they do move every day, taking walks and working in their vegetable gardens.

- ***ANTIAGING SECRETS***
    - As such, though challenges are good for keeping mind and body active, we should adjust our high-stress lifestyles in order to avoid the premature aging of our bodies.    
    - Spending too much time seated at work or at home not only reduces muscular and respiratory fitness but also increases appetite and curbs the desire to participate in activities. Being sedentary can lead to hypertension, imbalanced eating, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even certain kinds of cancer. Recent studies have shown a connection between a lack of physical activity and the progressive distortion of telomeres in the immune system, which ages those cells and, in turn, the organism as a whole.
    - One study, conducted at Yeshiva University, found that the people who live the longest have two dispositional traits in common: a positive attitude and a high degree of emotional awareness. In other words, those who face challenges with a positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their way toward longevity.
    - A stoic attitude—serenity in the face of a setback—can also help keep you young, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior. This can be seen in the greater life expectancies of certain cultures with unhurried, deliberate lifestyles.
    - Science has shown that sleep is a key antiaging tool, because when we sleep we generate melatonin, a hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies. The pineal gland produces it from the neurotransmitter serotonin according to our diurnal and nocturnal rhythms, and it plays a role in our sleep and waking cycles.
      A powerful antioxidant, melatonin helps us live longer, and also offers the following benefits:
      - It strengthens the immune system.
      - It contains an element that protects against cancer.
      - It promotes the natural production of insulin.
      - It slows the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.
      - It helps prevent osteoporosis and fight heart disease.
      
- ***FROM LOGOTHERAPY TO IKIGAI***      
    - Better living through logotherapy: A few key ideas
      - We don’t create the meaning of our life, as Sartre claimed—we discover it.
      - We each have a unique reason for being, which can be adjusted or transformed many times over the years.
      - Just as worry often brings about precisely the thing that was feared, excessive attention to a desire (or “hyper-intention”) can keep that desire from being fulfilled.
      - Humor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety.
      - We all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in which we find ourselves.
    
- ***FIND FLOW IN EVERYTHING YOU DO***
    - There is no future, no past. There is only the present. You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or distracted by anything else.
    - What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions can help us discover our ikigai.  
    - There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your ikigai, but one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through this state, to have an “optimal experience.” In order to achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the time we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing ourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure —like eating too much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front of the TV.
    - Flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”
    - When we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without any distractions. Our mind is “in order.” The opposite occurs when we try to do something while our mind is on other things.
    - The Seven Conditions for Achieving Flow:
          1. Knowing what to do
          2. Knowing how to do it
          3. Knowing how well you are doing
          4. Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved)
          5. Perceiving significant challenges
          6. Perceiving significant skills
          7. Being free from distractions
    - If you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you consider important, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your chances of achieving flow:-
        1. Choose a difficult task (but not too difficult!)
            - Take on tasks that we have a chance of completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone.
            - We want to see challenges through to the end because we enjoy the feeling of pushing ourselves. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar idea when he said, “To be able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult achievement.”
        2. Have a clear, concrete objective
            - Having a clear objective is important in achieving flow, but we also have to know how to leave it behind when we get down to business. Once the journey has begun, we should keep this objective in mind without obsessing over it.      
        3. Concentrate on a single task
            - Those who claim to be good at multitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least productive people.
            - Our brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually process a few dozen per second. When we say we’re multitasking, what we’re really doing is switching back and forth between tasks very quickly.
            - Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in achieving flow.
            - In order to focus on a task we need:
              1. To be in a distraction-free environment
              2. To have control over what we are doing at every moment
            - How can we train our brains to focus on a single task? Here are a few ideas for creating a space and time free of distractions, to increase our chances of reaching a state of flow and thereby getting in touch with our ikigai:
                - Don’t look at any kind of screen for the first hour you’re awake and the last hour before you go to sleep.
                - Turn off your phone before you achieve flow. There is nothing more important than the task you have chosen to do during this time. If this seems too extreme, enable the “do not disturb” function so only the people closest to you can contact you in case of emergency. 
                - Designate one day of the week, perhaps a Saturday or Sunday, a day of technological “fasting,” making exceptions only for e-readers (without Wi-Fi) or MP3 players.
                - Go to a café that doesn’t have Wi-Fi.
                - Read and respond to e-mail only once or twice per day. Define those times clearly and stick to them.
                - Try the Pomodoro Technique: Get yourself a kitchen timer (some are made to look like a pomodoro, or tomato) and commit to working on a single task as long as it’s running. The Pomodoro Technique recommends 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest for each cycle, but you can also do 50 minutes of work and 10 minutes of rest. Find the pace that’s best for you; the most important thing is to be disciplined in completing each cycle.
                - Start your work session with a ritual you enjoy and end it with a reward.
                - Train your mind to return to the present when you find yourself getting distracted. Practice mindfulness or another form of meditation, go for a walk or a swim—whatever will help you get centered again.
                - Work in a space where you will not be distracted. If you can’t do this at home, go to a library, a café, or, if your task involves playing the saxophone, a music studio. If you find that your surroundings continue to distract you, keep looking until you find the right place.
                - Divide each activity into groups of related tasks, and assign each group its own place and time. For example, if you’re writing a magazine article, you could do research and take notes at home in the morning, write in the library in the afternoon, and edit on the couch at night.
                - Bundle routine tasks—such as sending out invoices, making phone calls, and so on—and do them all at once.
            - It is important to protect ones space, control their environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai.

- ***LESSONS FROM JAPAN’S CENTENARIANS***    
    - Few secrets to longevity:
        1. Don't worry
        2. Cultivate good habits
        3. Nurture your friendships every day
        4. Live an unhurried life
        5. Be optimistic
    - Keys to the Ogimi Lifestyle
        - One hundred percent of the people we interviewed keep a vegetable garden, and most of them also have fields of tea, mangoes, shikuwasa, and so on.
        - All belong to some form of neighborhood association, where they feel cared for as though by family.
        - They celebrate all the time, even little things. Music, song, and dance are essential parts of daily life.
        - They have an important purpose in life, or several. They have an ikigai, but they don’t take it too seriously. They are relaxed and enjoy all that they do.
        - They are very proud of their traditions and local culture.
        - They are passionate about everything they do, however insignificant it might seem
        - Locals have a strong sense of yuimaaru—recognizing the connection between people. They help each other with everything from work in the fields (harvesting sugarcane or planting rice) to building houses and municipal projects. Our friend Miyagi, who ate dinner with us on our last night in town, told us that he was building a new home with the help of all his friends, and that we could stay there the next time we were in Ogimi.
        - They are always busy, but they occupy themselves with tasks that allow them to relax. We didn’t see a single old grandpa sitting on a bench doing nothing. They’re always coming and going—to sing karaoke, visit with neighbors, or play a game of gateball.    
        
- ***THE IKIGAI DIET***
    - Okinawa’s miracle diet:
        - **Locals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables:** Variety seems to be key. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our fast-food culture. 
        - **They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day**: At least seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily basis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to make sure you’re “eating the rainbow.” A table featuring red peppers, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily calories comes from vegetables.
        - **Grains are the foundation of their diet:** Japanese people eat white rice every day, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as well.
        - **They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it’s cane sugar:** We drove through several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.
        - In addition to these basic dietary principles, Okinawans eat fish an average of three times per week
        - Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of
        - Japan’s population. They also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per day, compared to an average of 12.
        - They consume fewer calories: an average of 1,785 per day, compared to 2,068 in the rest of Japan. **In fact, low caloric intake is common among the five Blue Zones.**
    - Antioxidants are molecules that slow the oxidation process in cells, neutralizing the free radicals that cause damage and accelerate aging.    
    - Because they are rich in antioxidants and are eaten nearly every day in the region, **these fifteen foods are considered keys to Okinawan vitality:**
        - Tofu
        - Miso
        - Tuna
        - Carrots
        - Goya (bitter melon)
        - Kombu (sea kelp)
        - Cabbage
        - Nori (seaweed)
        - Onion
        - Soy sprouts
        - Hechima (cucumber-like gourd)
        - Soybeans (boiled or raw)
        - Sweet potato
        - Peppers
        - Sanpin-cha (jasmine tea)
        
- ***GENTLE MOVEMENTS, LONGER LIFE***
    - STUDIES FROM THE Blue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who do the most exercise but rather the ones who move the most.
    
- ***RESILIENCE AND WABI-SABI***
    - Resilience is our ability to deal with setbacks. The more resilient we are, the easier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our lives.    
    - Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of their strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune. They concentrate on the things they can control and don’t worry about those they can’t.
    - According to Stoicism, our pleasures and desires are not the problem. We can enjoy them as long as they don’t take control of us. The Stoics viewed those who were able to control their emotions as virtuous. What’s
    - The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility (apatheia): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity, and anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity, and gratitude.
    - In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them.
    - In addition to negative visualization and not giving in to negative emotions, another central tenet of Stoicism is knowing what we can control and what we can’t, as we see in the Serenity Prayer.
    - It’s not what happens to you, but how you react that matters.
    - In Zen Buddhism, meditation is a way to become aware of our desires and emotions and thereby free ourselves from them. It is not simply a question of keeping the mind free of thoughts but instead involves observing our thoughts and emotions as they appear, without getting carried away by them. In this way, we train our minds not to get swept up in anger, jealousy, or resentment.
    - Another key to cultivating resilience is knowing in which time to live. Both Buddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the only thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we should appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now.
    - In addition to living in the here and now, the Stoics recommend reflecting on the impermanence of the things around us.
    - We should never forget that everything we have and all the people we love will disappear at some point. This is something we should keep in mind, but without giving in to pessimism. Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who surround us.
    - **Wabi-sabi** is a Japanese concept that shows us the beauty of the fleeting, changeable, and imperfect nature of the world around us. Instead of searching for beauty in perfection, we should look for it in things that are flawed, incomplete.
    - A complementary Japanese concept is that of **ichi-go ichi-e**, which could be translated as “This moment exists only now and won’t come again.” It is heard most often in social gatherings as a reminder that each encounter— whether with friends, family, or strangers—is unique and will never be repeated, meaning that we should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or the future.
    - We use the word **fragile** to describe people, things, and organizations that are weakened when harmed, and the words **robust and resilient** for things that are able to withstand harm without weakening, but we don’t have a word for things that get stronger when harmed (up to a point). **Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.”**
    - How can we be more antifragile?
        1. **Create redundancies:** 
            - Instead of having a single salary, try to find a way to make money from your hobbies, at other jobs, or by starting your own business. If you have only one salary, you might be left with nothing should your employer run into trouble, leaving you in a position of fragility. On the other hand, if you have several options and you lose your primary job, it might just happen that you end up dedicating more time to your secondary job, and maybe even make more money at it. You would have beaten that stroke of bad luck and would be, in that case, antifragile.
        2. **Bet conservatively in certain areas and take many small risks in others:** 
            - If you have $10,000 saved up, you might put $9,000 of that into an index fund or fixed-term deposit, and invest the remaining $1,000 in ten start-ups with huge growth potential—say, $100 in each. One possible scenario is that three of the companies fail (you lose $300), the value of three other companies goes down (you lose another $100 or $200), the value of three goes up (you make $100 or $200), and the value of one of the start-ups increases twenty-fold (you make nearly $2,000, or maybe even more).
        3. **Get rid of the things that make you fragile:** 
            - To build resilience into our lives, we shouldn’t fear adversity, because each setback is an opportunity for growth. If we adopt an antifragile attitude, we’ll find a way to get stronger with every blow, refining our lifestyle and staying focused on our ikigai.

- ***EPILOGUE***
    - Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don’t let them take over your life.            
    - Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us connect with our ikigai. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or change those you dislike. Be led by your curiosity, and keep busy by doing things that fill you with meaning and happiness. It doesn’t need to be a big thing: we might find meaning in being good parents or in helping our neighbors.
    - **THE TEN RULES OF IKIGAI**
        1. Stay active; don’t retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. That’s why it’s so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, and shaping the world around you, even after your “official” professional activity has ended.
        2. Take it slow. Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you’ll go far.” When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.
        3. Don’t fill your stomach. Less is more when it comes to eating for long life, too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.
        4. Surround yourself with good friends. Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.
        5. Get in shape for your next birthday. Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn’t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy. 
        6. Smile. A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing—it also helps make friends. It’s good to recognize the things that aren’t so great, but we should never forget what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.
        7. Reconnect with nature. Though most people live in cities these days, human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it often to recharge our batteries.
        8. Give thanks. To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every day giving thanks, and you’ll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.
        9. Live in the moment. Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.
        10. Follow your ikigai. There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you don’t know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your mission is to discover it.
