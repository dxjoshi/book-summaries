- **When to ask for a raise**
    1. First, know that it’s normal to ask.
    2. Be thoughtful about your timing.
        - You’re going to approach your manager to request this raise, and your manager is a human with normal human emotions. That means that you shouldn’t ask to talk about your salary when she’s especially harried or having a bad day or nervous about impending budget cuts. On the other hand, if you’ve just saved the day with an important client or garnered rave reviews for a high-profile project, or if your boss has seemed particularly pleased with you lately, now might be a particularly good time to make the request.
    3. If you’ve been doing excellent work for a year since your salary was last set, it might be time to ask.
    4. Know your company’s raise and budget cycles.
        - Plan to initiate the conversation with your boss at least a month or two before that formal process begins. If you wait until decisions on raises have already been made, it might be too late for her to get changes made.

    5. Know what your work is worth and start by researching online.
    6. Factor in your company’s salary structure.

    7. What to say when you ask for a raise.
        - I really appreciate the opportunities you’ve given me for greater responsibilities, like X and Y. I’ve been getting great results in those areas over the last year and have exceeded the goals we’d created. Could we talk about adjusting my salary to reflect this higher level of contribution?
        - I’m hoping we can talk about my salary. It’s been a year since my last raise, and I’ve taken on a number of new responsibilities since then. I’m managing all our copywriters and was even able to smooth out that long-running issue with the design team, which ended up saving us a ton of time in the last few months. I think things are going really well, and I’d like to talk about increasing my salary to reflect this new work.
        - “Would it be all right if we spent some time during my performance review discussing my compensation?”
        - “I’d like to set a short meeting to discuss my compensation. Please let me know if this time works for you.”
    8. Know what to say if the answer is “no” or “maybe.”
        - Lots of managers won’t say yes on the spot. But if you get a “maybe,” make sure you’re clear on what next steps are. It’s okay to say something like, “Could I plan to check back with you when we meet on the 20th?” Alternately, if your boss is generally good about following up on things, you might just go with a simple, “Thanks! I appreciate it.”
        - And if the answer is no, this is a perfect opportunity to ask, “Can you tell me what you think it would take for me to earn a raise in the future?”
        - You can then assess whether you’re able and willing to follow the path your manager lays out (or whether a realistic path exists at all). And if your manager isn’t able to give you specifics about how you can earn a raise in the future, that’s a useful signal that if you want more money, you may need to leave in order to get it somewhere else.
        - **Manager**: Thank you for that overview. While I agree that you’ve contributed a great deal to the company, a raise of X percent may not be possible at this time.
          **Employee**: From my research, I’ve learned that X percent is a reasonable increase and in line with what I have contributed. Can you tell me more about why that increase isn’t possible today?
          **Manager**: That amount is not something I have in the budget right now but it’s something I could make a case for in the future.
          **Employee**: That makes sense. What I’m hearing is that you agree that my receiving a raise is appropriate but maybe not right now. How can I help you make that case in the near future?
               
**Throughout your pitch, avoid words that could undercut your position, like stating that you believe, feel, think. just, only or might deserve this raise. These words can make it seem that you are not feeling confident or sure. If you convey uncertainty, your manager may become uncertain too. Go into this conversation knowing that you deserve a raise and communicate your confidence with strong words that leave little room for negotiation.**


1. Share your goals and ask for feedback.
    - Have an honest and open conversation with your manager. “If you've been in your current role for at least six months, then in a non-pushy or self-serving way, have a conversation with your supervisor to let them know that, while your first priority is to excel in your current role, your long-term goal is to advance and that you want to make sure you're doing everything that you can to set yourself up for success".
    - Don’t stop there. “Ask for their recommendations on how you can improve in your current role and what you can do to position yourself well for the next role.” Then implement the feedback so you’re on track when it’s time to make your ask.
2. Take on more responsibility.
    - First, command the tasks and responsibilities in your current role, and then start solving the problems that your soon-to-be self would be working on. The only way to effectively do this is through careful time management. Understand the core strategy of your organization, ask lots of hard questions and align your priorities with that of the company. You'll be running the show in no time.
3. Proactively communicate wins.
4. Demonstrate your accomplishments and added value.
    - You want to be able to demonstrate that you have taken on additional responsibilities, as well as provide specific details about your accomplishments.
    - You need to demonstrate how you’ve gone above and beyond to add value to your team and organization.             
5. Focus on why you deserve it (not why you need it).
    - The best approach to asking for a raise is to focus on deserving one versus needing one. Too often, people argue that a raise is important because of very real costs in their lives, however, an employer is looking to give raises to people based on performance.
    - Stick to discussing your performance and impact.
6. Practice your pitch and anticipate questions.
    - This sounds strange and unnatural to a lot of people, but conversations in which you are asking for something almost always go better if you've rehearsed in advance and have considered the many possible responses that you'll get to each of your requests, and how you'll address these responses.
7. Do your research.
    - Before any salary negotiation, conduct background research to determine your market value. You need to have a solid foundation for the request and realistic expectations. Study salary trends for professionals in your geographic area and industry with similar job titles, qualifications and responsibilities.
8. Talk about the future.
    - Every manager values loyalty. Start the conversation on a positive note, and explain how much you like working for your manager and the company. Then explain what you want to do in the future, and how you plan to contribute to grow the business.
9. Be prepared to hear no.
    - Don’t be discouraged by a no. “If you don’t get the pay increase or new position you requested, it doesn’t have to be the end of your negotiation. Request an interim performance appraisal with clearly defined goals and salary adjustment before your next annual review. This puts you in line for a possible increase sooner and also communicates how seriously you take your career.
    - If a raise and promotion isn’t going to happen right now, she suggests asking for things beyond salary such as professional development opportunities or more vacation time.
         
**Regardless of how the conversation went, end by thanking your manager for their time. Later that day or the next, send them a follow-up email that recaps your reasons for asking for a raise and include a summary of the conversation you had.**
                
- **Dealing with a NO**
    1. **Ask what will get you a raise.**
    2. **Check for a better time.**
    3. **Take a bonus.**
    4. **Get a better destination:** Asking for a higher designation increases chances for better salary hike, in case ceiling is reached for your current role or level.  
    5. **Negotiate Work Content:**
