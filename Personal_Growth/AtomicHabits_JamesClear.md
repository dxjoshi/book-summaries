- **Chapter-1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits**
    - It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.
    - Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable— sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.    
    - **Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement**. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.    
    - A single bad decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there— that eventually leads to a problem.   
    - Similarly, **a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination**. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.  
    - **Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits**. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.    
    - **Time magnifies the margin between success and failure**. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.   
    - **Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change**. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.   
    - **Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance**. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.    
    - This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential. **If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success**. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress—that makes the jump today possible.   
    - **Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results**. If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a milliondollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.
    - What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. **Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress**. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems. 
        - **Winners and losers have the same goals:** Every candidate wants to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.    
        - **Achieving a goal is only a momentary change:** Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. **You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.**   
        - **Goals restrict your happiness:** The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out.  
          **A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.**     
        - **Goals are at odds with long-term progress:** Finally, **a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect**. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. **When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal**. 
          **The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.**  
    - If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. **You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems**.  
    - **Atomic habits:**—A regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.
