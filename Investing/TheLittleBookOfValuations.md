- There are four basic inputs that we need for a value estimate: cash flows
  from existing assets (net of reinvestment needs and taxes); expected growth
  in these cash flows for a forecast period; the cost of financing the assets;
  and an estimate of what the firm will be worth at the end of the forecast
  period.
