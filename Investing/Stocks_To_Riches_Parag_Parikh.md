### Investing Strategy:
- Make an investment plan for yourself.
- Decide the different types of investment vehicles you need and the procedure you need to adopt.

- ***Cash Flow:*** 
A stock derives its value from its dividends. The capital appreciation that takes place is seen primarily from the angle of bonus and right shares, which in turn increase the shareholding leading to higher dividends. As a result the shareholder’s cash flow is augmented. The rise in stock price is
secondary, as there is no intention of selling for capital gain. 
- ***Capital Gain:*** 
When a stock goes up in value and one sells it at a profit, that gain is known as capital gain.

- ***Risk-Reward Balance:*** 
The important thing to remember is that investing is all about risk and reward. The higher the risk the greater the reward and vice versa. The investor needs to select the right balance when choosing an investment vehicle and the strategy.

- ***Nothing is Right or Wrong:*** 
    * Long-term investing can be very rewarding if you buy the right company at the right price.
    * Benjamin Graham’s words of warning: “Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”

### 3 Ways Of Investing:
- ***Intellectually Difficult Path:*** 
    * Investors like Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Johnger, J Templeton, and a few others have taken the intellectually difficult path of beating the markets. This path is pursued by those who have a profound understanding of investing, can see future trends clearly, and can comprehend business and the environment. **They know that patience is a virtue and therefore take long-term positions.**
    * **They strongly believe that opportunities are always there but that when the biggest of them come, one must have the money to invest. They are therefore, very careful about allocating resources. They never buy on impulse.** They can be out of the market for months, even years. They have the patience to wait till the right moment Brokers usually do not like such investors as they do not churn their portfolios regularly. **Intellectual investors are also emotionally strong.**

- ***Physically Difficult Path:*** 
The day traders also take the physically difficult path of investing. They spend the entire day collecting information and make decisions based on that information. **The current volatility in the markets is the result of too many people trying to invest by this method.**

- ***Emotionally Difficult Path:*** 
    * When your friends or your broker tell you about a great investment opportunity and they say it is a great time to buy, don’t buy.
      When the newspapers report big investment opportunities, be wary of such news.
      When your neighbours tell of how the stock markets have made them rich in the last couple of months, don’tbe tempted.
    * The emotionally difficult path like the intellectually difficult path lays stress on the virtue of patience. **Both are based on the view that the long-term approach to investments is the only strategy that can enrich investors and increase their wealth. The stress is on the cash flow approach. Patience focuses an investor’s attention on the goal of compounding money over a long period.**
    * **The more you churn your portfolio the more you pay the broker in terms of brokerage and off course the government in terms of taxes on your capital gains.** Then you also have costs like depository charges, transaction tax and service tax. All these costs could be avoided if one has patience.

### Behavioural Finanace:
- ***If Investments do well, why do investors fare poorly?*** 
Yet whenever we ask investors about their performance, the majority say that equity investments are risky and they have lost money in the stock market.
They always curse the volatility and blame it for their losses. Even well educated investors with an above average IQ do not do well on the stock markets.
It’s a paradox that while equity investments have done well investors have done poorly.
**The reality is that human beings make decisions not only with their minds but also with their hearts. Our emotions define us and we make most of our life decisions on purely emotional considerations.
Our logic and rationale only retrospectively justify these decisions; they do not determine them. Our emotions are subject to change rapidly and this affects our behaviour and decision-making.**

- ***Behavioural Econonmic Theory:*** 
Behavioural finance raises a couple of important issues for investors. 
    * The first is whether or not it is possible to systematically exploit irrational market behaviour when it occurs. 
    * The second issue is how to avoid making sub-optimal decisions as an investor. The goal is to close the gap between how we actually make decisions and how we should make decisions.
    * Students and proponents of behavioural finance create investment strategies that capitalise on irrational investor behaviour. **They seek to identify market conditions in which investors are likely to overreact or under react to new information. These mistakes cause under priced or overpriced securities.** 
    * **The goal of behavioural finance strategies is to invest in or disinvest from these securities before most investors recognise their error, and to benefit from the subsequent jump or fall in prices once they do.**

### Loss Aversion And Sunk Cost Fallacy:
- As far as our feelings toward our losses are concerned, we suffer from two behavioural anomalies: 
     * **Loss Aversion: that is our fear of losing**, and 
     * **Sunk Cost Fallacy, that is our inability to forget money already spent.**
- As far as our feelings toward gains are concerned, we suffer from 
    * **Status Quo Bias, that is our inability to make decisions**, and 
    * **Endowment Effect, that is the tendency to fall in love with what we own and thus resist change**

- Why is it that when confronted with a sure profit we become conservative and when confronted with a loss we tend to take more risks?
**It’s because the pain of a loss is three times more than the pleasure of an equal amount of gain. Over time pain becomes terrifying and pleasure becomes boring.**

- ***Impact Of Loss Aversion:*** 
1. Investors tend to prefer fixed income investments to stocks.
2. **Investors tend to take their profits very early:** To be successful in the stock markets it is important to ride the winners and discard the losers. However, loss aversion makes us ultra conservative so we book profits very early. We all suffer from loss aversion and that is the reason we find that winners get small amount of profits and losers pile up huge losses. Winning streaks tend to be short-lived.
3. **Investors take more risks when threatened with a loss**
4. **Investors tend to hold on to losers and sell winners:** A portfolio of stocks with a few winners at the top followed by a long list of losers is not uncommon. As discussed earlier it is because we go for sure gains and take more risks when threatened with a loss.
    So if you have one such portfolio you need to know that your decision-making is being controlled by loss aversion. Instead of riding the winners you are riding the losers.

> ***THE IDEA THAT INVESTORS ARE NOT RISK AVERSE BUT LOSS AVERSE IS ONE OF THE MAIN TENETS OF BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE.***

- ***Impact OF Sunk Cost Fallacy:*** 
1. **Averaging Cost of Purchase:** Generally, when investors go wrong in their purchase of stock they buy more at every fall. They believe that this will bring down the cost of their purchase. There is nothing wrong in that, provided they are confident that the stock has great value. But if they buy only to justify past actions, then they are prone to sunk cost fallacy.
2. Spending on Repairs
3. Government Spending on Unviable Projects


    > To find out whether you are you a victim of Loss Aversion and Sunk Cost Fallacy answer these questions.
        * Do you prefer fixed income securities over stocks?
        * Are you tempted to move out of the markets when prices fall?
        * Does your portfolio consist of a few winners followed by a long list of losers?
        * Do you sell your winners fast and hold on to losers?
        * Do you make important spending decisions based on your past spending?
        If your answer to all the questions is yes, then you are a victim of Loss Aversion and Sunk Cost Fallacy. 
        
- ***The following suggestions will enable you to make wiser investment decisions in the future.*** 
1. Check your appetite for loss.
2. **Diversify within asset classes and Across assets:**
    One needs to not only diversify within asset classes but also across different assets. A portfolio of equity stocks can be diversified by limiting an individual stock exposure to around 10 per cent and an industry exposure to around 20 per cent. Similarly, all the wealth should not be put into one asset class only; it could be distributed between stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, mutual funds, etc. The idea is that a loss in one asset could be offset by a gain in another. So you are less likely to react emotionally and act foolishly on impulse. As discussed earlier, taking an overall view of your portfolio helps you to avoid loss aversion traps.
3. **Total Portfolio Visison:**
    You could put your information reports on a spreadsheet to get the big picture. Secondly, it is important to have a solid investment philosophy and a strategy in place. It’s best to put the investment plan down on paper. For example, suppose you take an asset allocation approach. Determine the portion of the portfolio to be invested in stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. Write down the rationale behind each investment particularly if it is stocks. Writing it down increases your commitment to follow the course. In fact it is a way of using sunk cost fallacy to your advantage because you are committing yourself to the plan and will stick by it. When you identify your goals and justify all your investments in the context of achieving those goals you are less likely to react to the ups and downs of the markets.
4. Let bygones be bygones
5. Reframe losses as gains: If there is a loss look at the positive side. You will be able to adjust it against your gains as it is tax deductible.
6. Segregate gains and integrate losses.
7. Pay less attention to your investments:
    **The point is the more frequently we check our investments the more we feel the urge to react to the ups and downs of the markets.** For investors who do not trade professionally. A six-month review of a portfolio is frequent enough to make necessary adjustments in asset allocation. Yes, one might miss a market dip or a rise but it is a good trade off against peace of mind.

### Decision Paralysis And The Endowment Effect:
- A significant consequence of decision paralysis in financial decisions is that by deferring purchase you may miss the opportunity or run the risk of prices rising.
- How often have you not seen a stock move up and regret you did not buy it when you could at a much lower price?
- We have to understand that deciding not to take a decision is also a decision. When we take a decision we give ourselves a chance to move from the present comfort zone. Once we do that we have a 50-50 chance of going right or wrong. If we choose not to take a decision we miss this chance of going right. **Maintaining a status quo in times of continuous change is definitely unwise.**
- The endowment effect leads people to go in for instant gratification and to ignore future opportunity costs. Some people refuse to invest in public provident funds even though they benefit from the employer having to put in an equal amount. They want to enjoy the pleasure of getting the whole salary without deduction. Only, this pleasure comes at the cost of foregoing future higher benefits.
- Because of the endowment effect investors get caught up in their desire to seek endorsement of their actions. Investors seek information that supports their existing point of view, while avoiding information that contradicts their opinion. Psychologist Thane Pigman in Slip of the Tongue sums it up well: “I see it when I believe it.” Company visits and analysts meet are good examples of confirmation traps.

- ***Plan Of Action:*** 
1. Deciding not to decide is also a decision.
2. **Consider the opportunity costs:** You believe that investing in stocks is a risky decision. You prefer to keep your money in bank deposits. This is not wrong, but when you invest in stocks you are investing in the future. Suppose when you had the opportunity to invest in stocks you didn’t and the price went up. You would regret not taking a chance when you could. Imagining the benefits that would accrue will help you to overcome your resistance to change.
Put yourself on autopilot: Every month earmark a fixed sum towards investment in stocks. This will enable you to ride the bull and the bear waves without panicking. On the contrary you will be able to manage the heartburns that come with this volatility.
3. **Change your frame of reference:** Approach decisions from a neutral state. Here’s how to do it. You hold shares of Tata Steel and your friend recommends that you sell it and buy Jindal Iron and Steel instead. You cannot decide what to do. The best way is to imagine that you do not have any stock of Tata Steel but that you have cash that you can invest. You then decide between Tata Steel and Jindal. If your choice is Tata Steel then don’t convert. If the choice is Jindal, go ahead and make the switch. This sounds simple and it is. The difficult part is recognising that your decision is being hampered by your approach to the problem.
4. **Don’t get married to your stocks:** Investments are made to create income and wealth. Your goal is to go from one comfort level to another and for that you need different investment vehicles to meet your different requirements. Once they have fulfilled their task and helped you reach your goal you have to let go. You do not stay with them forever.
5. **Understand that there is no free lunch:** When you get to take home goods on trial, when you get invited for company visits, analysts’ meets, or sales promotion parties, please treat them with scepticism. Don’t allow yourself to feel good about such offers. Always look for the catch. Be detached and don’t allow your emotions to control your decision-making.
6. **Learn to apply the Dale Carnegie Principle on worry:** When we have to take decisions we worry about the consequences. Before running away, ask yourself what is the worst that can happen if you take the decision. Analyse the facts and the situation; it may not be as bad as you think. Be prepared for the worst, then go ahead and take the decision.

### Mental Accounting:
- Mental Accounting is an idea developed and championed by Richard Thaler. It underlines one of the most common and costly mistakes people make when dealing with money. It is the tendency to place different values to the same sum of money depending on how it has been acquired and the effort required to acquire it. Traditional economic theory assumes that money is fungible, meaning that one type of monetary unit can replace another. This means that Rs. 100 in lottery winnings, Rs. 100 in salary and a Rs. 100 tax refund should have the same meaning as they have the same purchasing power. But studies indicate this is not so with individuals. People mentally separate their money in different accounts, giving each account a different significance.
- ***Different Types Of Mental Accounting:*** 
1. **Earned Income Vs Gift Income**
2. **Quality Of The Money in Question:** We create mental accounts according to the quantity of the money and treat them differently. A tax refund is a tax deferral payment by the tax authorities. But when we get a tax refund of say Rs. 1000 we are likely to spend that without giving it due thought. However, a tax refund of Rs. 20000 will set us thinking whether to deposit it in a bank, or buy mutual funds and stocks. We do this because small amounts go into the miscellaneous account and big amounts go into important decision accounts.
3. **Large Vs. Small Purchases:** When you want to buy a fridge you make a lot of enquiries before making the purchase. You check out models and prices and even brands. When you have found one you like you do some hard bargaining and maybe get a discount of Rs. 500 on a fridge costing Rs. 20,000. That makes you happy, but do you do the same when shopping for groceries? Do you realise that if you put in a little effort and are able to save Rs. 10 a day, at the end of the year it would add up to a savings of Rs. 3500? Compare this with the saving of Rs. 500 on an expense that may not recur for the next 10 years or so. Many people are cost conscious when making large financial decisions, but they relax their discipline when it comes to small purchases. But that’s where the difference matters.
4. **Sacred Money:** Ramesh was a successful investor and had done reasonably well for himself. One day he inherited Rs. 10 lakhs from his uncle. The uncle had worked hard and saved his money all his life. He did not take any risks and looked after his money with care. Ramesh treated this money as sacred as he had received it from someone who had toiled all his life to earn it. He would not consider putting it into the stock market where he had done reasonably well. Instead he put it into bank deposits. The money was marked “sacred” in his mental account. Had his uncle been extravagant maybe Ramesh would have played the stock markets with that money.
5. **Cash Vs. Credit Cards**

- ***Impact Of Mental Accounting On Investors:*** 
1. Why do investors hold on to losing investments? **They may offer various reasons to justify their action but the fact remains that mentally they are unwilling to accept that they are making a loss.** Mentally we tend to believe that we book a loss only when we sell. Intellectually we recognise the loss but we hope that it will vanish. This is a common mental accounting error. On the contrary a loss can be adjusted against a profit, resulting in tax savings. Yet investors continue to fall prey to this common mental accounting error.
2. **Most people believe that a bonus share is a freebie given by the company to its shareholders. They even buy more shares on such news. But they are dead wrong. Companies give bonus shares to capitalise reserves and balance their finances.** But investors don’t see it that way. They consider it to be a windfall. This leads them to become extravagant. Most investors suffer from this mental accounting error. That’s why the stock markets rise on such announcements.



- ***Plan Of Action:*** 
    The best advice is to refrain from using credit cards, and to treat all monies equally.
1. **Always pay cash**
2. **Be Alert:** The car entails a big expense the cost of the accessories seem negligible and you may be tempted to spend on something you don’t really require.
3. **Be Patient**
4. **Treat All Money as Income:** The best way to be resourceful with your money is to treat all money as earned income. Whenever you get any money ask yourself this question: How long will it take me to earn this amount of money after taxes?

### Mental Heuristics:
Although both the lines are the same why is it that the lower line appears longer? That’s because the brain takes a short cut when processing information. It does not process all the information and this leads to biases. This process is known as **Mental Heuristics**. 
The dictionary definition of the word **heuristic** refers to the process by which people reach conclusions, usually by trial and error. This often leads them to develop thumb rules, but these are not always accurate. One of the greatest advances of behavioural psychology is the identification of the principles underlying these thumb rules and the errors associated with them. In turn these rules have themselves come to be called heuristics. 

**The following four statements define Heuristic Bias**.
- People develop general principles as they find out things for themselves. 
- People rely on heuristics to draw inferences from available information. 
- People are susceptible to certain errors because the heuristics they use are imperfect. 
- People actually commit errors in particular situations.
 
>Take the example of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) when the company discovered a gas vein. The stock jumped as investors cashed in on this news. But let us analyse the situation without falling prey to mental heuristics. The gas source was discovered but there were other factors to be considered—the quality of the gas, the number of wells to be drilled, the time it would take, the plans to finance the project, etc.—before the profits could be reaped. Yet analysts predicted the future profitability of RIL and on such hopes investors bought the stock at rising prices. This is how mental heuristics work when the brain does not process all the information and its implications. 

- ***Availability Heuristics:*** 
Post analysis revealed that the India Shining story had been aggressively sold in the major cities; hence the exit polls in these cities placed the NDA’s chances very high. But 70 per cent of the population lives in the rural areas and for them India was not shining. Thus NDA lost. On May 17, 2004 the markets crashed by more than 800 points in just two days. The reason: all available information was negative. In bull markets there is only positive news and in bear markets it is only negative. That’s why markets go up or come down on reflexivity.

- ***Representative Heuristics:*** 
We assess the likelihood of an event by its similarity to other occurrences. A predominant bias associated with this is over reaction. In the stock markets, if the leaders report impressive performances then all the stocks in that particular sector benefit. The fortunes of the steel industry seemed to be changing and Tata Steel reported increased earnings and profits. All the stocks in the sector, including the junk and penny stocks, attracted investors’ interest irrespective of whether they too would report increased earnings. 

- ***Saliency Heuristics:*** 
Individuals over react to an unusual event assuming it to be a permanent trend. Two aeroplanes crash into the World Trade Centre and the world stops flying the next day. 

- ***OverConfidence:*** 
    * In your position you should have known that these stocks would go up. Even I did. Unfortunately I was not handling our portfolio or else it would have been very different.” I had nothing to say to this inexperienced, overconfident young man. The proud father supported him. The son soon became an active player in the markets. Then, in 1995/1996 the markets crashed. This money was lost, the father had a stroke and the family had to leave Mumbai and settle down in their hometown in Gujarat. All this because of the son’s overconfidence. There are many others like him. My advice is, **respect the markets. They are interesting because we cannot understand them.**
    * Successful investors sometimes believe that they are skilful because they are doing well with their investments. However, they fail to realise that their investment performance is the result of the stock market performance, not necessarily their individual abilities. **In bullish times the stock markets are up and so is the performance of most of the mutual funds. By definition they capture the mutuality of the markets**. It is at this point that fund managers can become overconfident and go all out to garner more business. There is a famous saying, **“A rising tide lifts all boats”. A corollary to that would be “A rising market lifts all egos”.**

- ***Anchoring and Adjustment:*** 
Individuals start with an initial value and make value assessments based on that value. The initial value may reflect historical precedent, current information or random information. The bias reflects people’s insufficient adjustment to their initial values. The problem is acute when the initial value is not properly grounded. When individuals are anchored they under react to any new information that is made available to them. This is how anchoring becomes dangerous.

- ***Herd Mentality:*** 
In the stock markets most often investors allow popular opinion and behaviour to define values for them; sometimes for the good but often not. **Their buying or selling decisions are made not on the basis of their own convictions, but on the value that strangers appropriate.**

- ***Pattern Recognition:*** 
Investors anchor their future projections on past performances, seeing the future as a repeat of the past. In panic situations our minds may be guided by our emotions. Hence we may under react or overreact. Investing is a fairly emotional activity; hence we must be aware of our senses and our programmed responses to specific situations.
