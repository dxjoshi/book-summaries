- As I write this, the 10-year U.S. government bond rate is substantially lower than 6 percent. However, whenever the long-term government bond is paying less than 6 percent, we will still assume the rate is 6 percent. In other words, our other investment alternatives will, at a minimum, still have to beat 6 percent, no matter how low long-term U.S. government bond interest rates go. The big picture is that we want to make sure we earn a lot more from our other investments than we could earn without taking any risk. Obviously, if long-term U.S. government bond rates rose to 7 percent or higher, we would use 7 percent or that higher number. Now that’s really it.

### Chapter 3:
1. Buying a share in a business means you are purchasing a portion (or percentage interest) of that business. You are then entitled to a portion of that business’s future earnings.
2. Figuring out what a business is worth involves estimating (okay, guessing) how much the business will earn in the future.
3. The earnings from your share of the profits must give you more money than you would receive by placing that same amount of money in a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. (Remember: Last chapter we set 6 percent as your absolute minimum annual return when government bond rates fall below 6 percent) and
4. No, I haven’t forgotten about the magic formula. But you’re going to have to stop bugging me about it, okay? Sheesh!

### Chapter 4:
1. Stock prices move around wildly over very short periods of time. This does not mean that the values of the underlying companies have changed very much during that same period. In effect, the stock market acts very much like a crazy guy named Mr. Market.
2. It is a good idea to buy shares of a company at a big discount to your estimated value of those shares. Buying shares at a large discount to value will provide you with a large margin of safety and lead to safe and consistently profitable investments.
3. From what we’ve learned so far, you wouldn’t know a bargain-priced stock if it hit you in the head.
    * First, as we discussed, how are you supposed to know what a business is worth? If you can’t place a fair value on a company, then you can’t divide that number by the number of shares that exist, and you can’t figure out what the fair value of a share of stock is.
    * Second, if you could figure out a fair price or price range for the business, how would you know whether you were right, or even close to right? 
    
### Chapter 5:

- ***Earnings Yield:*** 
    * By looking at the income statement that Jason had provided us, it turned out that Jason’s chain of 10 gum shops had earned a total of $1.2 million last year—pretty impressive. Since Jason had divided his business into 1 million equal shares, we had concluded that each share was therefore entitled to $1.20 in earnings ($1,200,000 divided by 1,000,000 shares). At Jason’s asking price of $12 for each share, that meant that based on last year’s earnings, Jason’s Gum Shops would have given us a 10 percent return for each $12 share purchased ($1.20 divided by $12 = 10 percent). 
    * That 10 percent return, calculated by dividing the earnings per share for the year by the share price, is known as the **earnings yield.**
    * You would rather have a higher earnings yield than a lower one; you would rather the business earn more relative to the price you are paying than less!

- ***Return on Capital:*** 
    * A typical store in the Jason’s Gum Shops chain earns $200,000 each year from an initial investment of only $400,000. 
    * This works out to a 50 percent yearly return ($200,000 divided by $400,000) on the initial cost of opening a gum store. **This result is often referred to as a 50 percent return on capital.**
    * ***You would rather own a business that earns a high return on capital than one that earns a low return on capital!***

1. Paying a bargain price when you purchase a share in a business is a good thing. One way to do this is to purchase a business that earns more relative to the price you are paying rather than less. In other words, **a higher earnings yield is better than a lower one.**
2. Buying a share of a good business is better than buying a share of a bad business. One way to do this is to purchase a business that can invest its own money at high rates of return rather than purchasing a business that can only invest at lower ones. In other words, **businesses that earn a high return on capital are better than businesses that earn a low return on capital.**
3. Combining points 1 and 2, **buying good businesses at bargain prices is the secret to making lots of money.**


### Chapter 6:

- Graham’s formula involved purchasing companies whose stock prices were so low that the purchase price was actually lower than the proceeds that would be received from simply shutting down the business and selling off the company’s assets in a fire sale (he called these stocks by various names: bargain issues, net-current-asset stocks, or stocks selling below their net liquidation value).
- On average, Graham figured that the purchases made by using his formula would be bargains— bargains created by Mr. Market practically giving away businesses at unreasonably low prices.
- ***THE MAGIC FORMULA:*** 
    * buy shares in good businesses (ones with **high returns on capital**) but only when they were available at bargain prices (**priced to give us a high earnings yield**)
    * Getting excellent rankings in both categories (though not the top-ranked in either) would be better under this ranking system than being the top-ranked in one category with only a pretty good ranking in the other.
    
### Chapter 7:

1. The magic formula works for companies both large and small.
2. The magic formula was extensively tested. The great returns do not appear to be a matter of luck.
3. The magic formula ranks stocks in order. As a result, there should always be plenty of highly ranked stocks to choose from. The magic formula has been an incredibly accurate indicator of how a group of stocks will perform in the future!

    
### Chapter 8:

1. The magic formula appears to work very well over the long term.
2. The magic formula often doesn’t work for several years in a row.
3. Most investors won’t (or can’t) stick with a strategy that hasn’t worked for several years in a row.
4. For the magic formula to work for you, you must believe that it will work and maintain a long-term investment horizon.


### Chapter 9:

1. Most people and businesses can’t find investments
that will earn very high rates of return. A company
that can earn a high return on capital is therefore
very special.
2. Companies that earn a high return on capital may
also have the opportunity to invest some or all of
their profits at a high rate of return. This opportunity
is very valuable. It can contribute to a high rate
of earnings growth.
3. Companies that achieve a high return on capital are
likely to have a special advantage of some kind.
That special advantage keeps competitors from
destroying the ability to earn above-average profits.
4. By eliminating companies that earn ordinary or
poor returns on capital, the magic formula starts
with a group of companies that have a high return
on capital. It then tries to buy these above-average
companies at below-average prices.
5. Since the magic formula makes overwhelming
sense, we should be able to stick with it during
good times and bad.


### Chapter 10:

1. Although over the short term, Mr. Market may set stock prices based on emotion, over the long term, it is the value of the company that becomes most important to Mr. Market.
2. This means that if you buy shares at what you believe to be a bargain price and you are right, Mr. Market will eventually agree and offer to buy those shares at a fair price. In other words, bargain purchases will be rewarded. Though the process doesn’t always work quickly, two to three years is usually enough time for Mr. Market to get things right.

### Chapter 11:

- Rather than just blindly choosing stocks that catch your fancy or blindly accepting the output of the magic formula, how about combining both strategies? Start with the magic formula and put together a list of top-ranked stocks. Then choose a few of your favorites by whatever method you want. You must, however, choose solely from the top 50 or 100 stocks as ranked by the magic formula.* Using this method, you should still place at least 10 to 30 stocks in your portfolio (the lower end of this range if you actually know something about evaluating businesses and the higher end if you are choosing stocks based on birth signs).
1. Most people have no business investing in individual stocks on their own!
2. But if you must . . . and you can actually predict normalized earnings several years down the road, use those estimates to figure out earnings yield and return on capital. Then, use the principles of the magic formula to look for good companies at bargain prices based on your estimates of normal earnings.
3. If you truly understand the business that you own and have a high degree of confidence in your normalized earnings estimates, owning five to eight bargain-priced stocks in different industries can be a safe and effective investment strategy.


### Step by Step:

1. Use Return on Assets (ROA) as a screening criterion. Set the minimum ROA at 25%. (This will take the place of return on capital from the magic formula study.)
2. From the resulting group of high ROA stocks, screen for those stocks with the lowest Price/Earning (P/E) ratios. (This will take the place of earnings yield from the magic formula study.)
3. 
    1. Eliminate all utilities and financial stocks (i.e., mutual funds, banks and insurance companies) from the list.
    2. If a stock has a very low P/E ratio, say 5 or less, that may indicate that the previous year or the data being used are unusual in some way. You may want to eliminate these stocks from your list. You may also want to eliminate any company that has announced earnings in the last week. (This should help minimize the incidence of incorrect or untimely data.)
4. Buy five to seven top-ranked companies. To start, invest only 20 to 33 percent of the money you intend to invest during the first year.
5. Repeat Step 4 every two to three months until you have
invested all of the money you have chosen to allocate to your
magic formula portfolio. After 9 or 10 months, this should
result in a portfolio of 20 to 30 stocks (e.g., seven stocks
every three months, five or six stocks every two months).
6. Sell each stock after holding it for one year. Use the proceeds from any sale and any additional investment money to replace the sold companies with an equal number of new magic formula selections (Step 4).
7. Continue this process for many years. Remember, you must be committed to continuing this process for a minimum of three to five years, regardless of results. Otherwise, you will most likely quit before the magic formula has a chance to work!

- ***Return on Capital: EBIT/(Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)*** 
Return on capital was measured by calculating the ratio of pre-tax operating earnings (EBIT) to tangible capital employed (Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets). This ratio was used rather than the more commonly used ratios of return on equity (ROE, earnings/equity) or return on assets (ROA, earnings/assets) for several reasons.

- ***Earnings Yield: EBIT/Enterprise Value*** 
Earnings yield was measured by calculating the ratio of pre-tax operating earnings (EBIT) to **enterprise value (market value of equity + net interest-bearing debt).** This ratio was used rather than the more commonly used P/E ratio (price/earnings ratio) or E/P ratio (earnings/price ratio) for several reasons. The basic idea behind the concept of earnings yield is simply to figure out how much a business earns relative to the purchase price of the business.
