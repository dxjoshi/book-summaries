- ***Part I: PREPARING TO INVEST***
    - Before you think about buying stocks, you ought to have made some basic decisions about the market, about how much you trust corporate America, about whether you need to invest in stocks and what you expect to get out of them, about whether you are a short-or long-term investor, and about how you will react to sudden, unexpected, and severe drops in price. It’s best to define your objectives and clarify your attitudes (do I really think stocks are riskier than bonds?) beforehand, because if you are undecided and lack conviction, then you are a potential market victim, who abandons all hope and reason at the worst moment and sells out at a loss. It is personal preparation, as much as knowledge and research, that distinguishes the successful stockpicker from the chronic loser. Ultimately it is not the stock market nor even the companies themselves that determine an investor’s fate. It is the investor.
    - **The Making of a Stockpicker**
        - Logic is the subject that’s helped me the most in picking stocks, if only because it taught me to identify the peculiar illogic of Wall Street. Actually Wall Street thinks just as the Greeks did. the early Greeks used to sit around for days and debate how many teeth a horse has. they thought they could figure it out by just sitting there, instead of checking the horse. A lot of investors sit around and debate whether a stock is going up, as if the financial muse will give them the answer, instead of checking the company
                                                                                       
    - **The Wall Street Oxymorons**
        - Fund managers are restricted in a number of ways. For instance the SEC says a mutual fund such as mine cannot own more than ten percent of the shares in any given company, nor can we invest more than five percent of the fund’s assets in any given stock. An individual investors doesn't have those.
        - In fact, between the chance of making an unusually large profit on an unknown company and the assurance of losing only a small amount on an established company, the normal mutual-fund manager, pension-fund manager, or corporate-portfolio manager would jump at the latter. Success is one thing, but it’s more important not to look bad if you fail.
        - Fund managers in general spend a quarter of their working hours explaining what they just did.
        - the bigger the equity fund, the harder it gets for it to outperform the competition.    
        
    - **Is This Gambling, or What?**
        - Buy the right stocks at the wrong price at the wrong time and you’ll suffer great losses. Look what happened in the 1972–74 market break, when conservative issues such as Bristol-Myers fell from $9 to $4, Teledyne from $11 to $3, and McDonald’s from $15 to $4. these aren’t exactly fly-by-night companies. Buy the wrong stocks at the right time and you’ll suffer more of the same.
        - If they’ve done the proper homework on H & R Block and bought the stock, and suddenly the government simplifies the tax code (an unlikely prospect, granted) and Block’s business deteriorates, they accept the bad break and start looking for the next stock. they realize the stock market is not pure science, and not like chess, where the superior position always wins. If seven out of ten of my stocks perform as expected, then I’m delighted. If six out of ten of my stocks perform as expected, then I’m thankful. Six out of ten is all it takes to produce an enviable record on Wall Street.
        - Not wanting to “risk” investment capital that belonged to my mother-inlaw, Mrs. Charles Hoff, I once advised her to buy stock in Houston Industries, a very “safe” company. It was safe all right—the stock did nothing for more than a decade. I figured I could take more of a “gamble” with my own mother’s money, so I bought her the “riskier” Consolidated Edison. It went up sixfold. Con Ed wasn’t all that risky to those who had continued to monitor the fundamentals. the big winners come from the so-called high-risk categories, but the risks have more to do with the investors than with the categories.
            
    - **Passing the Mirror Test**
        - Before you buy a share of anything, there are three personal issues that ought to be addressed: (1) Do I own a house? (2) Do I need the money? and (3) Do I have the personal qualities that will bring me success in stocks? Whether stocks make good or bad investments depends more on your responses to these three questions
        - Only invest what you could afford to lose without that loss having any effect on your daily life in the foreseeable future.
        - It seems to me the list of qualities ought to include patience, self-reliance, common sense, a tolerance for pain, open-mindedness, detachment, persistence, humility, flexibility, a willingness to do independent research, an equal willingness to admit to mistakes, and the ability to ignore general panic.
        - It’s also important to be able to make decisions without complete or perfect information. things are almost never clear on Wall Street, or when they are, then it’s too late to profit from them.
        - things inside humans make them terrible stock market timers. the unwary investor continually passes in and out of three emotional states: concern, complacency, and capitulation. He’s concerned after the market has dropped or the economy has seemed to falter, which keeps him from buying good companies at bargain prices. then after he buys at higher prices, he gets complacent because his stocks are going up. this is precisely the time he ought to be concerned enough to check the fundamentals, but he isn’t. then finally, when his stocks fall on hard times and the prices fall to below what he paid, he capitulates and sells in a snit.
        - Some have fancied themselves “long-term investors,” but only until the next big drop (or tiny gain), at which point they quickly become short-term investors and sell out for huge losses or the occasional minuscule profit. It’s easy to panic in this volatile business.
                    
    - **Is this a Good Market? Please Don’t Ask**
        - **CockTail Theory:** 
            1. In the first stage of an upward market—one that has been down awhile and that nobody expects to rise again—people aren’t talking about stocks. In fact, if they lumber up to ask me what I do for a living, and I answer, “I manage anequity mutual fund,” they nod politely and wander away. If they don’t wander away, then they quickly change the subject to the Celtics game, the upcoming elections, or the weather. Soon they are talking to a nearby dentist about plaque. When ten people would rather talk to a dentist about plaque than to the manager of an equity mutual fund about stocks, it’s likely that the market is about to turn up.
            2. In stage two, after I’ve confessed what I do for a living, the new acquaintances linger a bit longer—perhaps long enough to tell me how risky the stock market is—before they move over to talk to the dentist. the cocktail party talk is still more about plaque than about stocks. the market’s up 15 percent from stage one, but few are paying attention.
            3. In stage three, with the market up 30 percent from stage one, a crowd of interested parties ignores the dentist and circles around me all evening. A succession of enthusiastic individuals takes me aside to ask what stocks they should buy. Even the dentist is asking me what stocks he should buy. Everybody at the party has put money into one issue or another, and they’re all discussing what’s happened.
            4. In stage four, once again they’re crowded around me—but this time it’s to tell me what stocks I should buy. Even the dentist has three or four tips, and in the next few days I look up his recommendations in the newspaper and they’ve all gone up. When the neighbors tell me what to buy and then I wish I had taken their advice, it’s a sure sign that the market has reached a top and is due for a tumble.

    - **What I hope you’ll remember most from this section are the following points:**
         - Don’t overestimate the skill and wisdom of professionals.
         - Take advantage of what you already know.
         - Look for opportunities that haven’t yet been discovered and certified by Wall Street—companies that are “off the radar scope.”
         - Invest in a house before you invest in a stock.
         - Invest in companies, not in the stock market.
         - Ignore short-term fluctuations.
         - Large profits can be made in common stocks.
         - Large losses can be made in common stocks.
         - Predicting the economy is futile.
         - Predicting the short-term direction of the stock market is futile.
         - the long-term returns from stocks are both relatively predictable and also far superior to the long-term returns from bonds.
         - Keeping up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an endless stud-poker hand.
         - Common stocks aren’t for everyone, nor even for all phases of a person’s life.
         - the average person is exposed to interesting local companies and products years before the professionals.
         - Having an edge will help you make money in stocks.
         - In the stock market, one in the hand is worth ten in the bush.

- ***PART II: PICKING WINNERS***
    - **Stalking the Tenbagger**
        - The best place to begin looking for the tenbagger is close to home— if not in the backyard then down at the shopping mall, and especially wherever you happen to work.
        - the average person comes across a likely prospect two or three times a year —sometimes more. Executives at Pep Boys, clerks at Pep Boys, lawyers and accountants, suppliers of Pep Boys, the firm that did the advertising, sign painters, building contractors for the new stores, and even the people who washed the floors all must have observed Pep Boys’ success. thousands of potential investors got this “tip,” and that doesn’t even count the hundreds of thousands of customers.
        - You don’t have to work in Kodak’s main office to learn that the new generation of inexpensive, easy-to-use, high-quality 35mm cameras from Japan is reviving the photo industry, and that film sales are up. You could be a film salesman, the owner of a camera store, or a clerk in a camera store. You could also be the local wedding photographer who notices that five or six relatives are taking unofficial pictures at weddings and making it harder for you to get good shots.
        - Did the doctors who prescribed Tagamet and Zantac buy shares in SmithKline and Glaxo? Somehow I doubt that many did. It’s more likely that the doctors were fully invested in oil stocks. Perhaps they heard that Union Oil of California was a takeover candidate. Meanwhile, the Union Oil executives were probably buying drug stocks, especially the hot issues like American Surgery Centers. Why it is that stock certificates, like grasses, are always greener in somebody else’s pasture I’m not sure.
        - the important point is that (1) the oil experts, on average, are in a better position than doctors to decide when to buy or to sell Schlumberger; and (2) the doctors, on average, know better than oil experts when to invest in a successful drug. the person with the edge is always in a position to outguess the person without an edge—who after all will be the last to learn of important changes in a given industry                         
        - the professional’s edge is especially helpful in knowing when and when not to buy shares in companies that have been around awhile, especially those in the so-called cyclical industries. If you work in the chemical industry, then you’ll be among the first to realize that demand for polyvinyl chloride is going up, prices are going up, and excess inventories are going down. You’ll be in a position(you have the edge over other investors) to know that no new competitors have entered the market and no new plants are under construction, and that it takes two to three years to build one. All this means higher profits for existing companies that make the product.

    - **I’ve Got It, I’ve Got It—What Is It?**
        - Just because Dunkin’ Donuts is always crowded or Reynolds Metals has more aluminum orders than it can handle doesn’t mean you ought to own the stock. Not yet. In fact, you ought to treat the initial information (whatever brought this company to your attention) as if it were an anonymous and intriguing tip, mysteriously shoved into your mailbox. this will keep you from buying a stock just because you’ve seen something you like, or worse, because of the reputation of the tipper, as in: “Uncle Harry’s buying it, and he’s rich, so he must know what he’s talking about.” Or: “Uncle Harry’s buying it, and so am I, because his last stock tip doubled.”
        - **"Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards."**  
        - Put as much effort into picking your stocks as you do into buying your groceries. Even if you already own stocks, it’s useful to go through the exercise, because it’s possible that some of these stocks will not and cannot live up to your expectations for them. that’s because there are different kinds of stocks, and there are limits to how each kind can perform. In developing the story you have to make certain initial distinctions.
        - But on the strength of Pampers alone, should you have rushed out to buy the stock? Not if you’d begun to develop the story. then, in about five minutes, you would have noticed that Procter and Gamble is a huge company and that Pampers sales contribute only a small part of the earnings. Pampers made some difference to Procter and Gamble, but it wasn’t nearly as consequential as what L’eggs did for a smaller outfit such as Hanes.
        - If you buy Coca-Cola at the right price, you might triple your money in six years, but you’re not going to hit the jackpot in two. there’s nothing wrong with Procter and Gamble or Coca-Cola, and recently both have been excellent performers. But you just have to know these are big companies so you won’t have false hopes or unrealistic expectations.
        - Everything else being equal, you’ll do better with the smaller companies. In the last decade you’d have made more money on Pic ’N’ Save than on Sears, although both are retail chains.
        - Once I’ve established the size of the company relative to others in a particular industry, next I place it into one of six general categories: slow growers, stalwarts, fast growers, cyclicals, asset plays, and turnarounds. 
        - The growth of an individual company is measured against the growth of the economy at large.
            1. **Slow-growers:** Usually these large and aging companies are expected to grow slightly faster than the gross national product. Slow growers didn’t start out that way. they started out as fast growers and eventually pooped out, either because they had gone as far as they could, or else they got too tired to make the most of their chances.
            2. **Stalwarts:** Stalwarts are companies such as Coca-Cola, Bristol-Myers, Procter and Gamble, the Bell telephone sisters, Hershey’s, Ralston Purina, and Colgate- Palmolive. these multibillion-dollar hulks are not exactly agile climbers, but they’re faster than slow growers. I always keep some stalwarts in my portfolio because they offer pretty good protection during recessions and hard times. It’s no accident that Kellogg can survive recessions. No matter how bad things get, people still eat cornflakes. they may take fewer trips, postpone the purchase of new cars, buy fewer clothes and expensive knickknacks, and order fewer lobster dinners at restaurants, but they eat just as many cornflakes as ever. Maybe they eat more cornflakes, to make up for the lack of lobsters.
            3. **Fast Growers:** these are among my favorite investments: small, aggressive new enterprises that grow at 20 to 25 percent a year. If you choose wisely, this is the land of the 10-to 40-baggers, and even the 200-baggers. With a small portfolio, one or two of these can make a career. A fast-growing company doesn’t necessarily have to belong to a fast-growing industry. All it needs is the room to expand within a slow-growing industry. Beer is a slowgrowing industry, but Anheuser-Busch has been a fast grower by taking over market share, and enticing drinkers of rival brands to switch to theirs. the same thing happened to Taco Bell in the fast-food business, Wal-Mart in the general store business, and the Gap in the retail clothing business. these upstart enterprises learned to succeed in one place, and then to duplicate the winning formula over and over, mall by mall, city by city. the expansion into new markets results in the phenomenal acceleration in earnings that drives the stock price to giddy heights. 
            4. **Cyclicals:** A cyclical is a company whose sales and profits rise and fall in regular if not completely predictable fashion. In a growth industry, business just keeps expanding, but in a cyclical industry it expands and contracts, then expands and contracts again. the autos and the airlines, the tire companies, steel companies, and chemical companies are all cyclicals.     Coming out of a recession and into a vigorous economy, the cyclicals flourish, and their stock prices tend to rise much faster than the prices of the stalwarts. this is understandable, since people buy new cars and take more airplane trips in a vigorous economy, and there’s greater demand for steel, chemicals, etc. But going the other direction, the cyclicals suffer, and so do the pocketbooks of the shareholders. You can lose more than fifty percent of your investment very quickly if you buy cyclicals in the wrong part of the cycle, and it may be years before you’ll see another upswing. Timing is everything in cyclicals, and you have to be able to detect the early signs that business is falling off or picking up. Shaky companies in cyclical industries are not the ones you sleep on through recessions.
            5. **Turnarounds:** Turnaround candidates have been battered, depressed, and often can barely drag themselves into Chapter 11. these aren’t slow growers; these are no growers. these aren’t cyclicals that rebound; these are potential fatalities, such as Chrysler. The occasional major success makes the turnaround business very exciting, and very rewarding overall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
            6. **The Asset Plays:** An asset play is any company that’s sitting on something valuable that you know about, but that the Wall Street crowd has overlooked. the asset may be as simple as a pile of cash. Sometimes it’s real estate.
        - Advanced Micro Devices and Texas Instruments, once champion fast growers, are now regarded as cyclicals. Cyclicals with serious financial problems collapse and then reemerge as turnarounds. Growth companies that can’t stand prosperity foolishly diworseify and fall out of favor, which makes them into turnarounds. A fast grower such as Holiday Inn inevitably slows down, and the stock is depressed until some smart investors realize that it owns so much real estate that it’s a great asset play.    
        - Disney, over its lifetime, has been in every major category: years ago it had the momentum of a fast grower, which led to the size and financial strength of a stalwart, followed by a period when all those great assets in real estate, old movies, and cartoons were significant. then, in the mid-1980s, when Disney was in a slump, you could have bought it as a turnaround.
        - Putting stocks in categories is the first step in developing the story. Now at least you know what kind of story it’s supposed to be. the next step is filling in the details that will help you guess how the story is going to turn out.          

    - **The Perfect Stock, What a Deal!**
        - **IT SOUNDS DULL—OR, EVEN BETTER, RIDICULOUS:** the perfect stock would be attached to the perfect company, and the perfect company has to be engaged in a perfectly simple business, and the perfectly simple business ought to have a perfectly boring name. the more boring it is, the better. Automatic Data Processing is a good start. But Automatic Data Processing isn’t as boring as Bob Evans Farms.
        - **IT DOES SOMETHING DULL:** I get even more excited when a company with a boring name also does something boring. Crown, Cork, and Seal makes cans and bottle caps. A company that does boring things is almost as good as a company that has a boring name, and both together is terrific. Both together is guaranteed to keep the oxymorons away until finally the good news compels them to buy in, thus sending the stock price even higher.
        - **IT DOES SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE:** Better than boring alone is a stock that’s boring and disgusting at the same time. Something that makes people shrug, retch, or turn away in disgust is ideal. Take Safety-Kleen., it goes around to all the gas stations and provides them with a machine that washes greasy auto parts.
        - **IT’S A SPINOFF:** Spinoffs of divisions or parts of companies into separate, freestanding entities—such as Safety-Kleen out of Chicago Rawhide. Large parent companies do not want to spin off divisions and then see those spinoffs get into trouble, because that would bring embarrassing publicity that would reflect back on the parents. therefore, the spinoffs normally have strong balance sheets and are well-prepared to succeed as independent entities
        - **THE INSTITUTIONS DON’T OWN IT, AND THE ANALYSTS DON’T FOLLOW IT:** 
        - **THERE’S SOMETHING DEPRESSING ABOUT IT:** In this category my favorite all-time pick is Service Corporation International (SCI). Now, if there’s anything Wall Street would rather ignore besides toxic waste, it’s mortality. And SCI does burials.    
        - **IT’S A NO-GROWTH INDUSTRY:** Many people prefer to invest in a high-growth industry, where there’s a lot of sound and fury. Not me. I prefer to invest in a low-growth industry like plastic knives and forks, but only if I can’t find a no-growth industry like funerals. that’s where the biggest winners are developed. As soon as a computer company designs the best word-processor in the world, ten other competitors are spending $100 million to design a better one, and it will be on the market in eight months. this doesn’t happen with bottle caps, couponclipping services, oil-drum retrieval, or motel chains
        - **IT’S GOT A NICHE:** A movie company competes with other movie companies, and the rock pit has a niche. Twentieth Century-Fox understood that when it bought up Pebble Beach, and the rock pit with it. Certainly, owning a rock pit is safer than owning a jewelry business. If you’re in the jewelry business, you’re competing with other jewelers from across town, across the state, and even abroad, since vacationers can buy jewelry anywhere and bring it home. But if you’ve got the only gravel pit in Brooklyn, you’ve got a virtual monopoly, plus the added protection of the unpopularity of rock pits. Brand names such as Robitussin or Tylenol, Coca-Cola or Marlboro, are almost as good as niches. It costs a fortune to develop public confidence in a soft drink or a cough medicine. the whole process takes years.
        - **PEOPLE HAVE TO KEEP BUYING IT:** I’d rather invest in a company that makes drugs, soft drinks, razor blades, or cigarettes than in a company that makes toys. In the toy industry somebody can make a wonderful doll that every child has to have, but every child gets only one each.
        - **IT’S A USER OF TECHNOLOGY:** Instead of investing in computer companies that struggle to survive in an endless price war, why not invest in a company that benefits from the price war —such as Automatic Data Processing? As computers get cheaper, Automatic Data can do its job cheaper and thus increase its own profits.
        - **THE INSIDERS ARE BUYERS:** When insiders are buying like crazy, you can be certain that, at a minimum, the company will not go bankrupt in the next six months. When insiders are buying, I’d bet there aren’t three companies in history that have gone bankrupt near term. Long term, there’s another important benefit. When management owns stock, then rewarding the shareholders becomes a first priority, whereas when management simply collects a paycheck, then increasing salaries becomes a first priority. But in normal situations insider selling is not an automatic sign of trouble within a company. there are many reasons that officers might sell. they may need the money to pay their children’s tuition or to buy a new house or to satisfy a debt. they may have decided to diversify into other stocks. But there’s only one reason that insiders buy: they think the stock price is undervalued and will eventually go up. When stock is bought in by the company, it is taken out of circulation, therefore shrinking the number of outstanding shares. this can have a magical effect on earnings per share, which in turn has a magical effect on the stock price. If a company buys back half its shares and its overall earnings stay the same, the earnings per share have just doubled. Few companies could get that kind of result by cutting costs or selling more widgets.

    - **Stocks I’d Avoid!**
        - **If I could avoid a single stock, it would be the hottest stock in the hottest industry**, the one that gets the most favorable publicity, the one that every investor hears about in the car pool or on the commuter train—and succumbing to the social pressure, often buys. Hot stocks can go up fast, usually out of sight of any of the known landmarks of value, but since there’s nothing but hope and thin air to support them, they fall just as quickly. If you aren’t clever at selling hot stocks (and the fact that you’ve bought them is a clue that you won’t be), you’ll soon see your profits turn into losses, because when the price falls, it’s not going to fall slowly, nor is it likely to stop at the level where you jumped on.  Remember what happened to disk drives? the experts said that this exciting industry would grow at 52 percent a year—and they were right, it did. But with thirty or thirty-five rival companies scrambling on the action, there were no profits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
        - **BEWARE THE NEXT SOMETHING** when people tout a stock as the next of something, it often marks the end of prosperity not only for the imitator but also for the original to which it is being compared. When other computer companies were called the “next IBM,” you could have guessed that IBM would go through some terrible times, and it has.
        - **AVOID DIWORSEIFICATIONS** Instead of buying back shares or raising dividends, profitable companies often prefer to blow the money on foolish acquisitions. the dedicated diworseifier seeks out merchandise that is (1) overpriced, and (2) completely beyond his or her realm of understanding. this ensures that losses will be maximized.
        - **BEWARE THE WHISPER STOCK** What I try to remind myself (and obviously I’m not always successful) is that if the prospects are so phenomenal, then this will be a fine investment next year and the year after that. Why not put off buying the stock until later, when the company has established a record? Wait for the earnings. You can get tenbaggers in companies that have already proven themselves. 
        - **BEWARE THE MIDDLEMAN** the company that sells 25 to 50 percent of its wares to a single customer is in a precarious situation. Short of cancellation, the big customer has incredible leverage in extracting price cuts and other concessions that will reduce the supplier’s profits. It’s rare that a great investment could result from such an arrangement                                                                                                                     

    - **Earnings, Earnings, Earnings**
        - what makes a company valuable, and why it will be more valuable tomorrow than it is today. there are many theories, but to me, it always comes down to earnings and assets. Especially earnings. Sometimes it takes years for the stock price to catch up to a company’s value, and the down periods last so long that investors begin to doubt that will ever happen.
        - Although it’s easy to forget sometimes, a share of stock is not a lottery ticket. It’s part ownership of a business.
        - You can see the importance of earnings on any chart that has an earnings line running alongside the stock price. Books of stock charts are available from most brokerage firms, and it’s instructive to flip through them. On chart after chart the two lines will move in tandem, or if the stock price strays away from the earnings line, sooner or later it will come back to the earnings.
        - the p/e ratio can be thought of as the number of years it will take the company to earn back the amount of your initial investment— assuming, of course, that the company’s earnings stay constant.
        - An average p/e for a utility (7 to 9 these days) will be lower than the average p/e for a stalwart (10 to 14 these days), and that in turn will be lower than the average p/e of a fast grower (14–20). Some bargain hunters believe in buying any and all stocks with low p/e’s, but that strategy makes no sense to me. We shouldn’t compare apples to oranges. What’s a bargain p/e for a Dow Chemical isn’t necessarily the same as a bargain p/e for a Wal-Mart.
        - Check whether the p/e ratios of various stocks you own are low, high, or average, relative to the industry norms
        - Before you buy a stock, you might want to track its p/e ratio back through several years to get a sense of its normal levels.
        - If you buy Coca-Cola, for instance, it’s useful to know whether what you’re paying for the earnings is in line with what others have paid for the earnings in the past. the p/e ratio can tell you that.
        - If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You’ll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do.

    - **THE P/E OF THE MARKET** 
        - Company p/e ratios do not exist in a vacuum. the stock market as a whole has its own collective p/e ratio, which is a good indicator of whether the market at large is overvalued or undervalued
        - Interest rates have a large effect on the prevailing p/e ratios, since investors pay more for stocks when interest rates are low and bonds are less attractive.

    - **FUTURE EARNINGS**
        - Once you got into this game seriously, you’d be boggled by the examples of stocks that go down even though the earnings are up, because professional analysts and their institutional clients expected the earnings to be higher, or stocks that go up even though earnings are down, because that same cheering section expected the earnings to be lower. these are short-term anomalies, but nonetheless frustrating to the shareholder who notices them.
        - If you can’t predict future earnings, at least you can find out how a company plans to increase its earnings. then you can check periodically to see if the plans are working out. there are five basic ways a company can increase earnings*: reduce costs; raise prices; expand into new markets; sell more of its product in the old markets; or revitalize, close, or otherwise dispose of a losing operation.                      
                                                                  
    - **The Two-Minute Drill**
        - learn as much as possible about what the company is doing to bring about the added prosperity, the growth spurt, or whatever happy event is expected to occur. this is known as the “story.”
        - Before buying a stock, I like to be able to give a two-minute monologue that covers the reasons I’m interested in it, what has to happen for the company to succeed, and the pitfalls that stand in its path.
        - Ex. slow-growing company you’re thinking about, then presumably you’re in it for the dividend[this company has increased earnings every year for the last ten, it offers an attractive yield; it’s never reduced or suspended a dividend, and in fact it’s raised the dividend during good times and bad, including the last three recessions. It’s a telephone utility, and the new cellular operations may add a substantial kicker to the growth rate.]    
    
    - **Getting the Facts**
        - What you can’t get from the annual report you can get by asking your
          broker, by calling the company, by visiting the company, or by doing some grassroots research, also known as kicking the tires.
    
    - **READING THE REPORTS**
        - that’s a rule with annuals and perhaps with publications in general—the cheaper the paper the more valuable the information.
        - Check the consolidated balance sheet. the balance sheet lists the assets and then the liabilities. that’s critical to me. Check current Assets and Long Term Debt YOY.
        - FORD: In the top column marked Current Assets, I notice that the company has $5.672 billion in cash and cash items, plus $4.424 billion in marketable securities. Adding these two items together, I get the company’s current overallcash position, which I round off to $10.1 billion. Comparing the 1987 cash to the 1986 cash in the right-hand column, I see that Ford is socking away more and more cash. this is a sure sign of prosperity. then I go to the other half of the balance sheet, down to the entry that says “long-term debt.” Here I see that the 1987 long-term debt is $1.75 billion, considerably reduced from last year’s long-term debt. Debt reduction is another sign of prosperity. **When cash increases relative to debt, it’s an improving balance sheet. When it’s the other way around, it’s a deteriorating balance sheet.** Subtracting the long-term debt from the cash, I arrive at $8.35 billion, Ford’s “net cash” position. the cash and cash assets alone exceed the debt by $8.35 billion. **When cash exceeds debt it’s very favorable. No matter what happens, Ford isn’t about to go out of business.**
        - As often as not, it turns out that long-term debt exceeds cash, the cash has been shrinking and debt has been growing, and the company is in weak financial shape. **Weak or strong is what you want to know in this short exercise.**                                                    
        - I can also see that the number has been reduced in each of the past two years. this means that Ford has been buying back its own shares, another positive step.
          
    - **Some Famous Numbers**
        - **PERCENT OF SALES:** When I’m interested in a company because of a particular product—such as L’eggs, Pampers, Bufferin, or Lexan plastic—the first thing I want to know is what that product means to the company in question. What percent of sales does it represent? L’eggs sent Hanes stock soaring because Hanes was a relatively small company. Pampers was more profitable than L’eggs, but it didn’t mean as much to the huge Procter and Gamble.
        - **THE PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO:** the p/e ratio of any company that’s fairly priced will equal its growth rate. In general, a p/e ratio that’s half the growth rate is very positive, and one that’s twice the growth rate is very negative. Find the company's growth rate by calculating the percent increase in earnings from one year to the next(annual report).
          A slightly more complicated formula **enables us to compare growth rates to earnings, while also taking the dividends into account**. Find the long-term growth rate (say, Company X’s is 12 percent), add the dividend yield (Company X pays 3 percent), and divide by the p/e ratio (Company X’s is 10). 12 plus 3 divided by 10 is 1.5. Less than a 1 is poor, and 1.5 is okay, but what you’re really looking for is a 2 or better. A company with a 15 percent growth rate, a 3 percent dividend, and a p/e of 6 would have a fabulous 3.                                  
        - **THE CASH POSITION:** it’s always advisable to check the cash position (and the value of related businesses) as part of your research. You never know when you’ll stumble across a Ford. So with Ford selling for $38, you were getting the $16.30 in net cash and another $16.60 in the value of the finance companies, so the automobile business was costing you a grand total of $5.10 per share. And this same automobile business was expected to earn $7 a share. Was Ford a risky pick? At $5.10 per share it was an absolute steal, in spite of the fact that the stock was up almost tenfold already since 1982.
        - **THE DEBT FACTOR:** A normal corporate balance sheet has 75 percent equity and 25 percent debt. Ford’s equity-to-debt ratio is a whopping $18 billion to $1.7 billion, or 91 percent equity and less than 10 percent debt. that’s a very strong balance sheet. An even stronger balance sheet might have 1 percent debt and 99 percent equity. A weak balance sheet, on the other hand, might have 80 percent debt and 20 percent equity. Among turnarounds and troubled companies, I pay special attention to the debt factor. More than anything else, it’s debt that determines which companies will survive and which will go bankrupt in a crisis(Suzlon??). Young companies with heavy debts are always at risk. It’s the kind of debt, as much as the actual amount, that separates the winners from the losers in a crisis. there’s bank debt(Worst) and there’s funded debt(Best).
        - **DIVIDENDS:** Another argument in favor of dividend-paying stocks is that the presence of the dividend can keep the stock price from falling as far as it would if there were no dividend. The smaller companies that don’t pay dividends are likely to grow much faster because of it. If you do plan to buy a stock for its dividend, find out if the company is going to be able to pay it during recessions and bad times. 
        - **DOES IT PAY:** If you do plan to buy a stock for its dividend, find out if the company is going to be able to pay it during recessions and bad times. Cyclicals are not always reliable dividend-payers.                                                                                                                                                                    
        - **BOOK VALUE:** People invest in these on the theory that if the book value is $20 a share and the stock sells for $10, they’re getting something for half price. the flaw is that the stated book value often bears little relationship to the actual worth of the company. It often understates or overstates reality by a large margin. there’s another unwritten rule here: the closer you get to a finished product, the less predictable the resale value. You know how much cotton is worth, but who can be sure about an orange cotton shirt? Look what happened a few years ago when Warren Buffett, the savviest of investors, decided to close down the New Bedford textile plant that was one of his earliest acquisitions. Management hoped to get something out of selling the loom machinery, which had a book value of $866,000. But at a public auction, looms that were purchased for $5,000 just a few years earlier were sold for $26 each—below the cost of having them hauled away. What was worth $866,000 in book value brought in only $163,000 in actual cash. Overvalued assets on the left side of the balance sheet are especially treacherous when there’s a lot of debt on the right. Let’s say that a company shows $400 million in assets and $300 million in debts, resulting in a positive book value of $100 million. You know the debt part is a real number. But if the $400 million in assets will bring only $200 million in a bankruptcy sale, then the actual book value is a negative $100 million. When you buy a stock for its book value, you have to have a detailed understanding of what those values really are. At Penn Central, tunnels through mountains and useless rail cars counted as assets. 
        - **MORE HIDDEN ASSETS:** Just as often as book value overstates true worth, it can understate true worth. this is where you get the greatest asset plays. Companies that own natural resources—such as land, timber, oil, or precious metals—carry those assets on their book at a fraction of the true value. For instance, in 1987, Handy and Harman, a manufacturer of precious metals products, had a book value of $7.83 per share, including its rather large inventories of gold, silver, and platinum. But these inventories are carried on the books at the prices Handy and Harman originally paid for the metals—and that could have been thirty years ago. At today’s prices ($6.40 an ounce for silver and $415 for gold) the metals are worth over $19 per share. A couple of years ago Channel 5 in Boston sold for something like $450 million—that was the fair market price. However, when that station was originally awarded its license, it probably paid $25,000 to file the proper papers, maybe $1 million for the tower, and another $1 or $2 million for the studio. the whole shebang was worth $2.5 million on paper to begin with, and the $2.5 million was depreciated. At the time it was sold, this enterprise probably had a book value that was 300 times too low. Now that the station has changed owners, the new book value will be based on the $450-million sale price, so the anomaly will disappear. If you pay $450 million for a TV station worth $2.5 million on the books, the accounts call the extra $447.5 million “goodwill.” Goodwill is carried on the new books as an asset, and eventually it, too, will be written off. this in turn will create another potential asset play.
        - **CASH FLOW:** Cash flow is the amount of money a company takes in as a result of doing business. All companies take in cash, but some have to spend more than others to get it. this is a critical difference that makes a Philip Morris such a wonderfully reliable investment, and a steel company such a shaky one. A lot of people use the cash flow numbers to evaluate stocks. For instance, a $20 stock with $2 per share in annual cash flow has a 10-to-1 ratio, which is standard. A ten percent return on cash corresponds nicely with the ten percent that one expects as a minimum reward for owning stocks long term. A $20 stock with a $4-per-share cash flow gives you a 20 percent return on cash, which is terrific. And if you find a $20 stock with a sustainable $10-per-share cash flow, mortgage your house and buy all the shares you can find. But if cash flow is ever mentioned as a reason you’re supposed to buy a stock, make sure that it’s free cash flow that they’re talking about. Free cash flow is what’s left over after the normal capital spending is taken out. It’s the cash you’ve taken in that you don’t have to spend. Coastal Corporation is a good illustration of the virtues of free cash flow. By all the normal measures the company was fairly priced at $20 a share. Its earnings of $2.50 a share gave it a p/e of 8, which was standard for a gas producer and a diversified pipeline company at the time. But beneath this humdrum opportunity, something wonderful was going on. Coastal had borrowed $2.45 billion to acquire a major pipeline company, American Natural Resources. the beauty of the pipeline was that they didn’t have to spend much to maintain it. A pipeline, after all, doesn’t demand much attention. Mostly it just sits there. Maybe they’d dig down to patch a few holes, but otherwise they’d leave it alone in the ground. Meanwhile they’d depreciate it. Coastal had $10–11 per share in total cash flow in a depressed gas environment, and $7 was left over after capital spending. that $7 a share was free cash flow. On the books this company could earn nothing for the next ten years, and shareholders would get the benefit of the $7-a-share annual influx, resulting in a $70 return on their $20 investment. this stock had great upside potential on cash flow alone.
        - **INVENTORIES:** there’s a detailed note on inventories in the section called “management’s discussion of earnings” in the annual report. I always check to see if inventories are piling up. With a manufacturer or a retailer, an inventory buildup is usually a bad sign. When inventories grow faster than sales, it’s a red flag. A company may brag that sales are up 10 percent, but if inventories are up 30 percent, you have to say to yourself: “Wait a second. Maybe they should have marked that stuff down and gotten rid of it. Since they didn’t get rid of it, they might have a problem next year, and a bigger problem the year after that. the new stuff they make will compete with the old stuff, and inventories will pile up even higher until they’re forced to cut prices, and that means less profit.” In an auto company an inventory buildup isn’t so disturbing because a new car is always worth something, and the manufacturer doesn’t have to drop the price very far to sell it. A $35,000 Jaguar isn’t going to be marked down to $3,500. But a $300 purple miniskirt that’s out of style might not sell for $3. 
        - **GROWTH RATE:** that “growth” is synonymous with “expansion” is one of the most popular misconceptions on Wall Street, leading people to overlook the really great growth companies such as Philip Morris. You wouldn’t see it from the industry —cigarette consumption in the U.S. is growing at about a minus two percent a year. the key to it is that Philip Morris can increase earnings by lowering costs and especially by raising prices. that’s the only growth rate that really counts: earnings. Philip Morris has lowered costs by installing more efficient cigarette-rolling machinery. Meanwhile, the industry raises prices every year. If the company’s costs increase 4 percent, it can raise prices 6 percent, adding 2 percent to its profit margin. this may not seem like much, but if your profit margin is 10 percent (about what Philip Morris’s is) a 2-percentage-point rise in the profit margin means a 20 percent gain in earnings. If you find a business that can get away with raising prices year after year without losing customers (an addictive product such as cigarettes fills the bill), YOU'VEGOT A TERRIFIC INVESTMENT. One more thing about growth rate: all else being equal, a 20-percent grower selling at 20 times earnings (a p/e of 20) is a much better buy than a 10-percent grower selling at 10 times earnings (a p/e of 10). the widening gap in earnings between a 20-percent grower and a 10-percent grower that both start off with the same $1 a share in earnings: Company A is selling for $20 a share (20 times earnings of $1), and by the end it sells for $123.80 (20 times earnings of $6.19). Company B starts out selling for $10 a share (10 times earnings of $1) and ends up selling for $26 (10 times earnings of $2.60). this in a nutshell is the key to the bigbaggers, and why stocks of 20-percent growers produce huge gains in the market, especially over a number of years. It’s no accident that the Wal-Marts and the Limiteds can go up so much in a decade. It’s all based on the arithmetic of compounded earnings. 
        - **THE BOTTOM LINE:** So what is the real bottom line? It’s the final number at the end of an income statement: profit after taxes. Without getting bogged down in the technicalities, pretax profit margin is one more factor to consider in evaluating a company’s staying power in hard times. this gets very tricky, because on the upswing, as business improves, the companies with the lowest profit margins are the biggest beneficiaries.  What you want, then, is a relatively high profit-margin in a long-term stock that you plan to hold through good times and bad, and a relatively low profitmargin in a successful turnaround                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
    
    - **Rechecking the Story**
        - there are three phases to a growth company’s life: the start-up phase, during which it works out the kinks in the basic business; the rapid expansion phase, during which it moves into new markets; and the mature phase, also known as the saturation phase, when it begins to prepare for the fact that there’s no easy way to continue to expand. Each of these phases may last several years. the first phase is the riskiest for the investor, because the success of the enterprise isn’t yet established. the second phase is the safest, and also where the most money is made, because the company is growing simply by duplicating its successful formula. the third phase is the most problematic, because the company runs into its limitations. Other ways must be found to increase earnings. As you periodically recheck the stock, you’ll want to determine whether the company seems to be moving from one phase into another.

    - **The Final Checklist:**
        - All of this research I’ve been talking about takes a couple of hours, at most, for each stock.
        - **STOCKS IN GENERAL**
          - the p/e ratio. Is it high or low for this particular company and for similar companies in the same industry.
          - the percentage of institutional ownership. the lower the better.
          - Whether insiders are buying and whether the company itself is buying back its own shares. Both are positive signs.
          - the record of earnings growth to date and whether the earnings are sporadic or consistent. (the only category where earnings may not be important is in the asset play.)
          - Whether the company has a strong balance sheet or a weak balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio) and how it’s rated for financial strength.
          - the cash position. With $16 in net cash, I know Ford is unlikely to drop below $16 a share. that’s the floor on the stock.
        - **SLOW GROWERS**
          Since you buy these for the dividends (why else would you own them?) you want to check to see if dividends have always been paid, and whether they are routinely raised.
          - When possible, find out what percentage of the earnings are being paid out as dividends. If it’s a low percentage, then the company has a cushion in hard times. It can earn less money and still retain the dividend. If it’s a high percentage, then the dividend is riskier.
        - **STALWARTS**
          - these are big companies that aren’t likely to go out of business. the key issue is price, and the p/e ratio will tell you whether you are paying too much.
          - Check for possible diworseifications that may reduce earnings in the future.
          - Check the company’s long-term growth rate, and whether it has kept up the same momentum in recent years.
          - If you plan to hold the stock forever, see how the company has fared during previous recessions and market drops. (McDonald’s did well in the 1977 break, and in the 1984 break it went sideways. In the big Sneeze of 1987, it got blown away with the rest. Overall it’s been a good defensive stock. Bristol-Myers got clobbered in the 1973–74 break, primarily because it was so overpriced. It did well in 1982, 1984, and 1987. Kellogg has survived all the recent debacles, except for ’73–’74, in relatively healthy fashion.)
        - **CYCLICALS**
          - Keep a close watch on inventories, and the supply-demand relationship. Watch for new entrants into the market, which is usually a dangerous development.
          - Anticipate a shrinking p/e multiple over time as business recovers and investors look ahead to the end of the cycle, when peak earnings are achieved.
          - If you know your cyclical, you have an advantage in figuring out the cycles. (For instance, everyone knows there are cycles in the auto industry. Eventually there are going to be three or four up years to follow three or four down years. there always are. Cars get older and they have to be replaced. People can put off replacing cars for a year or two longer than expected, but sooner or later they are back in the dealerships.
          - the worse the slump in the auto industry, the better the recovery. Sometimes I root for an extra year of bad sales, because I know it will bring a longer and more sustainable upside. Lately we’ve had five years of good car sales, so I know we are in the middle, and perhaps somewhere close to the end, of a prosperous cycle. But it’s much easier to predict an upturn in a cyclical industry than it is to predict a downturn.)
        - **FAST GROWERS**
          - Investigate whether the product that’s supposed to enrich the company is a major part of the company’s business. It was with L’eggs, but not with Lexan.
          - What the growth rate in earnings has been in recent years. (My favorites are the ones in the 20 to 25 percent range. I’m wary of companies that seem to be growing faster than 25 percent. those 50 percenters usually are found in hot industries, and you know what that means.)
          - that the company has duplicated its successes in more than one city or town, to prove that expansion will work.
          - that the company still has room to grow. When I first visited Pic ’N’ Save, they were established in southern California and were just beginning to talk about expanding into northern California. there were forty-nine other states to go. Sears, on the other hand, is everywhere.
          - Whether the stock is selling at a p/e ratio at or near the growth rate.
          - Whether the expansion is speeding up (three new motels last year and five new motels this year) or slowing down (five last year and three this year). For stocks of companies such as Sensormatic Electronics, whose sales are primarily “one-shot” deals—as opposed to razor blades, which customers have to keep on buying—a slowdown in growth can be devastating. Sensormatic’s growth rate was spectacular in the late seventies and early eighties, but to increase earnings they had to sell more new systems each year than they had sold the year before. the revenue from the basic electronic surveillance system (the one time purchase) far overshadowed whatever they got from selling those little white tags to their established customers. So, in 1983, when the rate of growth slowed, earnings didn’t just slow, they dived. And so did the stock, from $42 to $6 in twelve months.
          - that few institutions own the stock and only a handful of analysts have ever heard of it. With fast growers on the rise this is a big plus.
        - **TURNAROUNDS**
          - Most important, can the company survive a raid by its creditors? How much cash does the company have? How much debt? (Apple Computer had $200 million in cash and no debt at the time of its crisis, so once again you knew it wasn’t going out of business.) What is the debt structure, and how long can it operate in the red while working out its problems without going bankrupt? (International Harvester— now Navistar—was a potential turnaround that has disappointed investors, because the company printed and sold millions of new shares to raise capital. this dilution resulted in the company’s having turned around, but not the stock.)
          - If it’s bankrupt already, then what’s left for the shareholders?
          - How is the company supposed to be turning around? Has it rid itself of unprofitable divisions? this can make a big difference in earnings. For example, in 1980 Lockheed earned $8.04 per share from its defense business, but it lost $6.54 per share in its commercial aviation division because of its L- 1011 TriStar passenger jet. the L-1011 was a great airplane, but it suffered from competition with McDonnell Douglas’s DC10 in a relatively small market. And in the long-distance market, it was getting killed by the 747. these losses were persistent, and in December, 1981, the company announced that it would phase out the L-1011. this resulted in a large write-off in 1981 ($26 per share), but it was a one-time loss. In 1982, when Lockheed earned $10.78 per share from defense, there were no more losses to deal with. Earnings had gone from $1.50 to $10.78 per share in two years! You could have bought Lockheed for $15 at the time of the L-1011 announcement. Within four years it hit $60, for a fourbagger.
          - Texas Instruments was another classic turnaround. In October, 1983, the company announced it would leave the home-computer business (another hot industry with too many competitors). It had lost over $500 million from home computers in that year alone. Again, the decision made for big write-offs, but it meant that the company could concentrate on its strong semiconductor and defense-electronics businesses. the day after the announcement, TI stock spurted from $101 to $124. And four months later it was $176. Time also has sold off divisions and dramatically cut costs. It is one of my favorite recent turnarounds. Actually it’s an asset play as well. the cable-TV part of the business is potentially worth $60 a share, so if the stock sells for $100, you’re buying the rest of the company for $40.
          - Is business coming back? (this is what’s happening at Eastman Kodak, which has benefited from the new boom in film sales.)
          - Are costs being cut? If so, what will the effect be? (Chrysler cut costs drastically by closing plants. It also began to farm out the making of a lot of the parts it used to make itself, saving hundreds of millions in the process. It went from being one of the highest-cost producers of automobiles to one of the lowest.
          - the turnaround in Apple Computer was harder to predict. However, if you’d been close to the company, you might have noticed the surge in sales, the cost-cutting, and the appeal of the new products, which all came at once.)
        - **ASSET PLAYS**
          - What’s the value of the assets? Are there any hidden assets?
          - How much debt is there to detract from these assets? (Creditors are first in line.)
          - Is the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?
          - Is there a raider in the wings to help shareholders reap the benefits of the assets?

        - **Here are some pointers from this section:**
          - Understand the nature of the companies you own and the specific reasons for holding the stock. (“It is really going up!” doesn’t count.)
          - By putting your stocks into categories you’ll have a better idea of what to expect from them.
          - Big companies have small moves, small companies have big moves.
          - Consider the size of a company if you expect it to profit from a specific product.
          - Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven that their concept can be replicated.
          - Be suspicious of companies with growth rates of 50 to 100 percent a year.
          - Avoid hot stocks in hot industries.
          - Distrust diversifications, which usually turn out to be diworseifications.
          - Long shots almost never pay off.
          - It’s better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a company’s plans are working out.
          - People get incredibly valuable fundamental information from their jobs that may not reach the professionals for months or even years.
          - Separate all stock tips from the tipper, even if the tipper is very smart, very rich, and his or her last tip went up.
          - Some stock tips, especially from an expert in the field, may turn out to be quite valuable. However, people in the paper industry normally give out tips on drug stocks, and people in the health care field never run out of tips on the coming takeovers in the paper industry.
          - Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favor, and haven’t caught the fancy of Wall Street.
          - Moderately fast growers (20 to 25 percent) in nongrowth industries are ideal investments.
          - Look for companies with niches.
          - When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the ones with the superior financial positions and avoid the ones with loads of bank debt.
          - Companies that have no debt can’t go bankrupt.
          - Managerial ability may be important, but it’s quite difficult to assess. Base your purchases on the company’s prospects, not on the president’s resume or speaking ability.
          - A lot of money can be made when a troubled company turns around.
          - Carefully consider the price-earnings ratio. If the stock is grossly overpriced, even if everything else goes right, you won’t make any money.
          - Find a story line to follow as a way of monitoring a company’s progress.
          - Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares.
          - Study the dividend record of a company over the years and also how its earnings have fared in past recessions.
          - Look for companies with little or no institutional ownership.
          - All else being equal, favor companies in which management has a significant personal investment over companies run by people that benefit only from their salaries.
          - Insider buying is a positive sign, especially when several individuals are buying at once.
          - Devote at least an hour a week to investment research. Adding up your dividends and figuring out your gains and losses doesn’t count.
          - Be patient. Watched stock never boils.
          - Buying stocks based on stated book value alone is dangerous and illusory. It’s real value that counts.
          - When in doubt, tune in later.
          - Invest at least as much time and effort in choosing a new stock as you would in choosing a new refrigerator
            
- ***Part III THE LONG-TERM VIEW***
    - **Designing a Portfolio**
        - By the way, when you are figuring out how you’re doing in stocks, don’t forget to include all the costs of subscriptions to newsletters, financial magazines, commissions, investment seminars, and long-distance calls to brokers.
        - Nine to ten percent a year is the generic long-term return for stocks, the historic market average.
        - In my view it’s best to own as many stocks as there are situations in which: (a) you’ve got an edge; and (b) you’ve uncovered an exciting prospect that passes all the tests of research. Maybe that’s a single stock, or maybe it’s a dozen stocks. Maybe you’ve decided to specialize in turnarounds or asset plays and you buy several of those; or perhaps you happen to know something special about a single turnaround or a single asset play. there’s no use diversifying into unknown companies just for the sake of diversity. A foolish diversity is the hobgoblin of small investors.
        - In small portfolios I’d be comfortable owning between three and ten stocks. there are several possible benefits:
          1. If you are looking for tenbaggers, the more stocks you own the more likely that one of them will become a tenbagger. Among several fast growers that exhibit promising characteristics, the one that actually goes the furthest may be a surprise.
          2. the more stocks you own, the more flexibility you have to rotate funds between them. this is an important part of my strategy. I never put more than 30–40 percent of my fund’s assets into growth stocks. Normally I keep about 10–20 percent or so in the stalwarts, another 10–20 percent or so in the cyclicals, and the rest in turnarounds
        - Spreading your money among several categories of stocks is another way to minimize downside risk. Slow growers are low-risk, low-gain because they’re not expected to do much and the stocks are usually priced accordingly. Stalwarts are low-risk, moderate gain. If you own Coca-Cola and everything goes right next year, you could make 50 percent; and if everything goes wrong, you could lose 20 percent. Asset plays are low-risk and high-gain if you’re sure of the value of the assets. If you are wrong on an asset play, you probably won’t lose much, and if you are right, you could make a double, a triple, or perhaps a five-bagger. Cyclicals may be low-risk and high-gain or high-risk and low-gain, depending on how adept you are at anticipating cycles. If you are right, you can get your tenbaggers here, and if you are wrong, you can lose 80–90 percent. Meanwhile, additional tenbaggers are likely to come from fast growers or from turnarounds—both high-risk, high-gain categories. the higher the potential upside, the greater the potential downside, and if a fast grower falters or the troubled old turnaround has a relapse, the downside can be losing all your money. At the time I bought Chrysler, if everything went right, I thought I could make 400 percent, and if everything went wrong, I could lose 100. there’s no pat way to quantify these risks and rewards, but in designing your portfolio you might throw in a couple of stalwarts just to moderate the thrills and chills of owning four fast growers and four turnarounds. Again, the key is knowledgeable buying. You don’t want to buy an overvalued stalwart and thus add to the very risk you’re trying to moderate     
        - Some people automatically sell the “winners”—stocks that go up—and hold
          on to their “losers”—stocks that go down—which is about as sensible as
          pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds. Others automatically sell their
          losers and hold on to their winners, which doesn’t work out much better. Both
          strategies fail because they’re tied to the current movement of the stock price as
          an indicator of the company’s fundamental value. 
        - As we’ve seen, the
          current stock price tells us absolutely nothing about the future prospects of a
          company, and it occasionally moves in the opposite direction of the
          fundamentals.
          **A better strategy, it seems to me, is to rotate in and out of stocks depending
          on what has happened to the price as it relates to the story.** For instance, if a
          stalwart has gone up 40 percent—which is all I expected to get out of it—and
          nothing wonderful has happened with the company to make me think there
          are pleasant surprises ahead, I sell the stock and replace it with another stalwart
          I find attractive that hasn’t gone up. In the same situation, if you didn’t want to
          sell all of it, you could sell some of it.
          By successfully rotating in and out of several stalwarts for modest gains, you
          can get the same result as you would with a single big winner: six 30-percent
          moves compounded equals a fourbagger plus.
        - Get out of situations in which the
          fundamentals are worse and the price has increased, and into situations in
          which the fundamentals are better and the price is down.
        - **If you can’t convince yourself “When I’m down 25 percent, I’m a buyer”
          and banish forever the fatal thought “When I’m down 25 percent, I’m a
          seller,” then you’ll never make a decent profit in stocks.**
        - there’s simply no
          way to rely on stops as protection on the downside, nor on artificial objectives
          as goals on the upside. If I’d believed in “Sell when it’s a double,” I would never
          have benefited from a single big winner, and I wouldn’t have been given the
          opportunity to write a book. Stick around to see what happens—as long as the
          original story continues to make sense, or gets better—and you’ll be amazed at
          the results in several years.  
                                        
    - **The Best Time to Buy and Sell**
        - there are two particular periods when great bargains are likely to be found.
        - the first is during the peculiar annual ritual of end-of-the-year tax selling. If you have a list of companies that you’d like to own if only the stock price were reduced, the end of the year is a likely time to find the deals you’ve been waiting for.
        - the second is during the collapses, drops, burps, hiccups, and freefalls that occur in the stock market every few years. If you can summon the courage and presence of mind to buy during these scary episodes when your stomach says “sell,” you’ll find opportunities that you wouldn’t have thought you’d ever see again. 
        - One of the biggest troubles with stock market advice is that good or bad it sticks in your brain. You can’t get it out of there, and someday, sometime, you may find yourself reacting to it.
        - Not buying because an insider has started
          selling can be as big a mistake as selling because an outsider (Petrie) has
          stopped buying. In the La Quinta case I ignored the nonsense, and I’m glad I
          did.
        - this is one instance where the amateur investor is just as vulnerable to folly
          as the professional. We have fellow experts whispering into our ears; you have
          friends, relatives, brokers, and assorted financial factotums from the media.
          Maybe you’ve received the “Congratulations: Don’t Be Greedy”
          announcement. that’s when the broker calls to say: “Congratulations, you’ve
          doubled your money on ToggleSwitch, but let’s not be greedy. Let’s sell
          ToggleSwitch and try KinderMind.” So you sell ToggleSwitch and it keeps
          going up, while KinderMind goes bankrupt, taking all of your profits with it.
        - **WHEN TO SELL A SLOW GROWER**
          - when there’s been a 30–50 percent appreciation or when the fundamentals have deteriorated, even if the stock has
          declined in price. Here are some other signs:
          - the company has lost market share for two consecutive years and is hiring
          another advertising agency.
          - No new products are being developed, spending on research and
          development is curtailed, and the company appears to be resting on its laurels.
          - Two recent acquisitions of unrelated businesses look like diworseifications,
          and the company announces it is looking for further acquisitions “at the
          leading edge of technology.”
          - the company has paid so much for its acquisitions that the balance sheet
          has deteriorated from no debt and millions in cash to no cash and millions in
          debt. there are no surplus funds to buy back stock, even if the price falls
          sharply.
          - Even at a lower stock price the dividend yield will not be high enough to
          attract much interest from investors.
        - **WHEN TO SELL A STALWART**
          there’s no point expecting a quick tenbagger in a stalwart, and if the stock
          price gets above the earnings line, or if the p/e strays too far beyond the normal
          range, you might think about selling it and waiting to buy it back later at a
          lower price—or buying something else, as I do.
          Other sell signs:
          - New products introduced in the last two years have had mixed results, and
          others still in the testing stage are a year away from the marketplace.
          - the stock has a p/e of 15, while similar-quality companies in the industry
          have p/e’s of 11–12.
          - No officers or directors have bought shares in the last year.
          - A major division that contributes 25 percent of earnings is vulnerable to
          an economic slump that’s taking place (in housing starts, oil drilling, etc.).
          - the company’s growth rate has been slowing down, and though it’s been
          maintaining profits by cutting costs, future cost-cutting opportunities are
          limited.       
        - **WHEN TO SELL A CYCLICAL** 
          - Falling commodity prices is another harbinger. Usually prices of oil, steel,
          etc., will turn down several months before the troubles show up in the
          earnings. Another useful sign is when the future price of a commodity is lower
          than the current, or spot, price.
          - Competition businesses are also a bad sign for cyclicals. the outsider will
            have to win customers by cutting prices, which forces everyone else to cut
            prices and leads to lower earnings for all the producers. As long as there’s
            strong demand for nickel and nobody to challenge Inco, Inco will do fine, but
            as soon as demand slackens or rival nickel producers begin to sell nickel, Inco’s
            got problems.
            Other signs:
          - Two key union contracts expire in the next twelve months, and labor
          leaders are asking for a full restoration of the wages and benefits they gave up
          in the last contract.
          - Final demand for the product is slowing down.
          - the company has doubled its capital spending budget to build a fancy
          new plant, as opposed to modernizing the old plants at low cost.
          - the company has tried to cut costs but still can’t compete with foreign
          producers.  
        - **WHEN TO SELL A FAST GROWER**
          - Here, the trick is not to lose the potential tenbagger. On the other hand, if
            the company falls apart and the earnings shrink, then so will the p/e multiple
            that investors have bid up on the stock. this is a very expensive double
            whammy for the loyal shareholders.
            the main thing to watch for is the end of the second phase of rapid growth,
            as explained earlier.
            If the Gap has stopped building new stores, and the old stores are
            beginning to look shabby, and your children complain that the Gap doesn’t
            carry acid-washed denim apparel, which is the current rage, then it’s probably
            time to think about selling. If forty Wall Street analysts are giving the stock
            their highest recommendation, 60 percent of the shares are held by
            institutions, and three national magazines have fawned over the CEO, then it’s
            definitely time to think about selling.
          - Unlike the cyclical where the p/e ratio gets smaller near the end, in a growth
            company the p/e usually gets bigger, and it may reach absurd and illogical
            dimensions. Remember Polaroid and Avon Products. P/e’s of 50 for companies
            of their size? Any astute fourth-grader could have figured it was time to sell
            those. Was Avon going to sell a billion bottles of perfume? How could it, when
            every other housewife in America was an Avon representative?
          - Same store sales are down 3 percent in the last quarter.
          - New store results are disappointing.
          - Two top executives and several key employees leave to join a rival firm.
          - the company recently returned from a “dog and pony” show, telling an
          extremely positive story to institutional investors in twelve cities in two weeks.
          - the stock is selling at a p/e of 30, while the most optimistic projections of
            earnings growth are 15–20 percent for the next two years.
        - **WHEN TO SELL A TURNAROUND**
          - the best time to sell a turnaround is after it’s turned around. All the
            troubles are over and everybody knows it. the company has become the old
            self it was before it fell apart: growth company or cyclical or whatever. the
            shareholders aren’t embarrassed to own it again. If the turnaround has been
            successful, you have to reclassify the stock. Some other signs:
            - Debt, which has declined for five straight quarters, just rose by $25
            million in the latest quarterly report.
            - Inventories are rising at twice the rate of sales growth.
            - the p/e is inflated relative to earnings prospects.
            - the company’s strongest division sells 50 percent of its output to one
            leading customer, and that leading customer is suffering from a slowdown in
            its own sales.    
        - **WHEN TO SELL AN ASSET PLAY**
          - Lately, the best idea is to wait for the raider. If there are really hidden assets
            there, Saul Steinberg, the Hafts, or the Reichmanns will figure it out. As long
            as the company isn’t going on a debt binge, thus reducing the value of the
            assets, then you’ll want to hold on.
          - With so many raiders around, it’s harder for the amateur to find a good
            asset stock, but it’s a cinch to know when to sell. You don’t sell until the Bass
            brothers show up, and if it’s not the Bass brothers, then it’s certain to be
            Steinberg, Icahn, the Belzbergs, the Pritzkers, Irwin Jacobs, Sir James
            Goldsmith, Donald Trump, Boone Pickens, or maybe even Merv Griffin. After
            that, there could be a takeover, a bidding war, or a leveraged buyout to double,
            triple or quadruple the stock price.
            Other sell signs:
            - Although the shares sell at a discount to real market value, management
            has announced it will issue 10 percent more shares to help finance a
            diversification program.
            - the division that was expected to be sold for $20 million only brings $12
            million in the actual sale.
            - the reduction in the corporate tax rate considerably reduces the value of
            the company’s tax-loss carryforward.

          - If you get interested in buying a turnaround, it ought to be for a more sensible reason than the stock’s gone down so far it looks like up to you. Maybe you realize that business is picking up, and you check the balance sheet and you see that the company has $11 per share in cash and the stock is selling for $14
        3. **IF IT’S GONE THIS HIGH ALREADY, HOW CAN IT POSSIBLY GO HIGHER?**
          - the point is, there’s no arbitrary limit to how high a stock can go, and if the story is still good, the earnings continue to improve, and the fundamentals haven’t changed, “can’t go much higher” is a terrible reason to snub a stock. Shame on all those experts who advise clients to sell automatically after they double their money. You’ll never get a tenbagger doing that
        4. IT’S ONLY $3 A SHARE: WHAT CAN I LOSE?
        5. EVENTUALLY THEY ALWAYS COME BACK
        6. IT’S ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN: Sometimes it’s always darkest before the dawn, but then again, other times it’s always darkest before pitch black.
        7. WHEN IT REBOUNDS TO $10, I’LL SELL   
        8. WHAT ME WORRY? CONSERVATIVE STOCKS DON’T FLUCTUATE MUCH: Companies are dynamic, and prospects change. there simply isn’t a stock you can own that you can afford to ignore.
        9. IT’S TAKING TOO LONG FOR ANYTHING TO EVER HAPPEN: If you give up on a stock because you’re tired of waiting for something wonderful to happen, then something wonderful will begin to happen the day after you get rid of it. I call this the postdivestiture flourish. Merck tested everybody’s patience (see chart). this stock went nowhere from 1972 to 1981, even though earnings grew steadily at an average of 14 percent a year. then what happened? It shot up fourfold in the next five years. I stuck with Merck because I’m accustomed to hanging around with a stock when the price is going nowhere. Most of the money I make is in the third or fourth year that I’ve owned something—only with Merck it took a little longer. If all’s right with the company, and whatever attracted me in the first place hasn’t changed, then I’m confident that sooner or later my patience will be rewarded.     
        10. **LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY I’VE LOST: I DIDN’T BUY IT!**
          - Regarding somebody else’s gains as your own personal losses is not a productive attitude for investing in the stock market. In fact, it can only lead to total madness. the more stocks you learn about, the more winners you realize that you’ve missed, and soon enough you’re blaming yourself for losses in the billions and trillions. If you get out of stocks entirely and the market goes up 100 points in a day, you’ll be waking up and muttering: “I’ve just suffered a $110 billion setback.”
          - the worst part about this kind of thinking is that it leads people to try to play catch up by buying stocks they shouldn’t buy, if only to protect themselves from losing more than they’ve already “lost.” this usually results in real losses.                                                                
        11. I MISSED THAT ONE, I’LL CATCH THE NEXT ONE
          - the trouble is, the “next” one rarely works, as we’ve already shown. If you missed Toys “R” Us, a great company that continued to go up, and then bought Greenman Brothers, a mediocre company that went down, then you’ve compounded your error. Actually you’ve taken a mistake that cost you nothing (remember, you didn’t lose anything by not buying Toys “R” Us) and turned it into a mistake that cost you plenty.
          - In most cases it’s better to buy the original good company at a high price than it is to jump on the “next one” at a bargain price
        12. THE STOCK’S GONE UP, SO I MUST BE RIGHT, OR... THE STOCK’S GONE DOWN SO I MUST BE WRONG
          - People often take comfort when their recent purchase of something at $5 a share goes up to $6, as if that proves the wisdom of the purchase. Nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, if you sell quickly at the higher price, then you’ve made a fine profit, but most people don’t sell in these favorable circumstances. Instead they convince themselves that the higher price proves that the investment is worthwhile, and they hold on to the stock until the lower price convinces them the investment is no good.

    - **50000 Frenchmen can be wrong**
        - Small investors are capable of handling all sorts of markets, as long as they own good merchandise. If anyone should worry, it’s some of the oxymorons. After all, the losses of last October were only losses to people who took the losses. that wasn’t the long-term investor. It was the margin player, the risk arbitrageur, the options player, and the portfolio manager whose computer signaled “sell” who took the losses. Like a cat who sees himself in a mirror, the sellers spooked themselves.
        - Wall Street studies for, clamors for, and then lines up for—all the while with a sharp eye on the exits. the idea is to make a quick gain and then stampede out the door.
        - Small investors don’t have to fight this mob. they can calmly walk in the entrance when there’s a crowd at the exit, and walk out the exit when there’s a crowd at the entrance. Here’s a short list of stocks that were the favorites of large institutions in mid-1987 but sold at sharply lower prices ten months later, in spite of higher earnings, exciting prospects, and good cash flows. the companies hadn’t changed, but the institutions had lost interest: Automatic Data Processing, Coca-Cola, Dunkin’ Donuts, General Electric, Genuine Parts, Philip Morris, Primerica, Rite Aid, Squibb, and Waste Management.          

- ***Options, Futures, and Shorts***
    - The stockpicker who invests in options as insurance often cannot help himself, and soon enough he’s buying options for their own sake, and from there it’s on to hedges, combinations, and straddles. He forgets that stocks ever interested him in the first place. Instead of researching companies, he spends all his waking hours reading market-timer digests and worrying about headand- shoulder patterns or zigzag reversals. Worse, he loses all his money. Warren Buffett thinks that stock futures and options ought to be outlawed, and I agree with him.

- ***If you take anything with you at all from this last section, I hope you’ll remember the following:***
    - Sometime in the next month, year, or three years, the market will decline sharply.
    - Market declines are great opportunities to buy stocks in companies you like. Corrections—Wall Street’s definition of going down a lot—push outstanding companies to bargain prices.
    - Trying to predict the direction of the market over one year, or even two years, is impossible. To come out ahead you don’t have to be right all the time, or even a majority of the time.
    - the biggest winners are surprises to me, and takeovers are even more surprising. It takes years, not months, to produce big results.
    - Different categories of stocks have different risks and rewards.
    - You can make serious money by compounding a series of 20–30 percent gains in stalwarts.
    - Stock prices often move in opposite directions from the fundamentals but long term, the direction and sustainability of profits will prevail.
    - Just because a company is doing poorly doesn’t mean it can’t do worse.
    - Just because the price goes up doesn’t mean you’re right.
    - Just because the price goes down doesn’t mean you’re wrong.
    - Stalwarts with heavy institutional ownership and lots of Wall Street coverage that have outperformed the market and are overpriced are due for a rest or a decline.
    - Buying a company with mediocre prospects just because the stock is cheap is a losing technique.
    - Selling an outstanding fast grower because its stock seems slightly overpriced is a losing technique.
    - Companies don’t grow for no reason, nor do fast growers stay that way forever.
    - You don’t lose anything by not owning a successful stock, even if it’s a tenbagger.
    - A stock does not know that you own it.
    - Don’t become so attached to a winner that complacency sets in and you stop monitoring the story.
    - If a stock goes to zero, you lose just as much money whether you bought it at $50, $25, $5, or $2—everything you invested.
    - By careful pruning and rotation based on fundamentals, you can improve your results. When stocks are out of line with reality and better alternatives exist, sell them and switch into something else.
    - When favorable cards turn up, add to your bet, and vice versa.
    - You won’t improve results by pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds.
    - If you don’t think you can beat the market, then buy a mutual fund and save yourself a lot of extra work and money.
    - there is always something to worry about.
    - Keep an open mind to new ideas.
    - You don’t have to “kiss all the girls.” I’ve missed my share of tenbaggers and it hasn’t kept me from beating the market.
