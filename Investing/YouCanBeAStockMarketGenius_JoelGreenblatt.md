### Chapter 5:

- ***LOOK DOWN, NOT UP:*** 
    - Risk, according to generally accepted wisdom, is defined as the risk of receiving volatile returns. In the academic world, risk is measured by a stock’s “beta”—the price volatility of a particular stock relative to the market as a whole. Usually the calculation of “beta” is based on an extrapolation of a stock’s past price volatility. In this topsy-turvy world, the distinction between upside volatility and downside volatility is greatly confused: a stock that moves up significantly over the course of a year is labeled riskier than a stock that moves down slightly during the same period.
    - Also, using past price movements (or volatility) as the basis for determining the riskiness of a particular stock can often lead to faulty conclusions. A stock that has fallen from 30 to 10 is considered riskier than a stock that has fallen from 12 to 10 in the same period. Although both stocks can now be purchased for $10, the stock which has fallen the farthest, and the one that is now priced at the biggest discount to its recent high price, is still considered the “riskier” of the two. It might be. But it could be that most of the stock’s downside risk has been eliminated by the huge price drop. The truth is you can’t really tell much of anything just from measuring a stock’s past price movements.
    - So one way to create an attractive risk/reward situation is to limit downside risk severely by investing in situations that have a large margin of safety. The upside, while still difficult to quantify, will usually take care of itself. In other words, look down, not up, when making your initial investment decision.


- ***THERE’S MORE THAN ONE ROAD TO INVESTMENT HEAVEN:*** 
    - It seems more than a coincidence that, of the small group of investors who have been extraordinarily successful over long periods of time, **most adhere in some form to Graham’s concepts of “margin of safety(buying stocks that trade at low prices relative to their book values and earnings provides superior longterm results OR (P/E)X NoOfShares is less than company's book value)”** and “Mr. Market.” 
    
- ***SPINOFFS***
    - A corporation takes a subsidiary, division, or part of its business and separates it from the parent company by creating a new, independent, free-standing company.
    - In most cases, shares of the new “spinoff” company are distributed or sold to the parent company’s existing shareholders.
    - **Stocks of spinoff companies, and even shares of the parent companies that do the spinning off, significantly and consistently outperform the market averages.**
    - Why do companies pursue spinoff transactions in the first place?
        1. Unrelated businesses may be separated via a spinoff transaction so that the separate businesses can be better appreciated by the market. 
        2. Sometimes, the motivation for a spinoff comes from a desire to separate out a “bad” business so that an unfettered “good” business can show through to investors.
        3. Sometimes a spinoff is a way to get value to shareholders for a business that can’t be easily sold.
        4. Tax considerations can also influence a decision to pursue a spinoff instead of an outright sale. A cash sale of the same division or subsidiary with the proceeds dividended out to shareholders would, in most cases, result in both a taxable gain to the corporation and a taxable dividend to shareholders.
        5. A spinoff may solve a strategic, antitrust, or regulatory issue, paving the way for other transactions or objectives.
                                                   
- ***SPINOFFS SUMMARIZED:***
1. Spinoffs, in general, beat the market.
2. Picking your spots, within the spinoff universe, can result in even better results than the average spinoff.
3. Certain characteristics point to an exceptional spinoff opportunity:
    1. Institutions don’t want the spinoff (and not because of the investment merits).
    2. Insiders want the spinoff.
    3. A previously hidden investment opportunity is uncovered by the spinoff transaction (e.g., a cheap stock, a great business, a leveraged risk/reward situation).
4. You can locate and analyze new spinoff prospects by reading the business press and following up with SEC filings.
5. Paying attention to “parents” can pay off handsomely.
6. Partial spinoffs and rights offerings create unique investment opportunities.
7. Keep an eye on the insiders.  


- ***Risk arbitrage—NO!***     
  ***Merger securities—YES!***

- ***Restructuring:***     

1. **Bankruptcy—some points to remember**
    1. Bankruptcies can create unique investment opportunities—but be choosy. 
    2. As a general rule, don’t buy the common stock of a bankrupt company. 
    3. The bonds, bank debt, and trade claims of bankrupt companies can make attractive investments—but first—quit your day job. 
    4. Searching among the newly issued stocks of companies emerging from bankruptcy can be worthwhile; just like spinoffs and merger securities, bargains are often created by anxious sellers who never wanted the stuff in the first place. 
    5. Unless the price is irresistible, invest in companies with attractive businesses—or as Damon Runyon put it, “It may be that the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong—but that is the way to bet.”
2. **Selling Tips**
    1. Trade the bad ones; invest in the good ones.
3. **Restructuring**
    1. Tremendous values can be uncovered through corporate restructurings.
    2. Look for situations that have limited downside, an attractive business to restructure around, and a well-incentivized management team.
    3. In potential restructuring situations, also look for a catalyst to set things in motion.
    4. Make sure the magnitude of the restructuring is significant relative to the size of the total company.
    5. Listen to your spouse. (Following this advice won’t guarantee capital gains, but the dividends are a sure thing.)
    

1. **Stub Stocks:** There is almost no other area of the stock market where research and careful analysis can be rewarded as quickly and as generously.
2. **LEAPS:** There is almost no other area of the stock market (with the possible exception of stub stocks) where research and careful analysis can be rewarded as quickly and as generously.
3. **Warrants and Special Situation Option Investing:** There is almost no other area of the stock market (with the possible exception of stub stocks and LEAPS) where research and careful analysis can be rewarded as quickly and as generously.


- ***Free Cash Flow:***
- Primarily, the noncash expenses are depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is a noncash accounting charge taken against earnings to allocate the cost of fixed assets like plant and equipment over their useful lives. 
- Amortization is also a noncash expense similar to depreciation, except that the annual charges to earnings represent the write-down of certain intangible assets over a period of time. Intangible assets have a life of one year or more and lack physical substance. Goodwill is the most common form of intangible asset.
- To calculate free cash flow in its basic form, you would 
    1. start with net income, 
    2. add back the noncash charges of depreciation and amortization, 
    3. then subtract a company’s capital expenditures, which usually represent cash outlays for investments in new plant and equipment. The result is a measure of how much free cash flow a company generated that year
